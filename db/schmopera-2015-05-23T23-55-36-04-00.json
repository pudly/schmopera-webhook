Voices of all sizes and shapes, too; beautiful, floating sopranos and, big, hollering baritones. On top of that, a whole hoard of people beneath the opera stage are playing as one, all of them looking up at one special guy with a [stick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0REJ-lCGiKU). But most importantly, the music written underneath the words gives us subtext, depth to the story. Music can tell us if someone’s [pious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pesXB2rtMBw), [thoughtful](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg3UCgMLXhE), [drunk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9azZtZdKk), if lovers are [doomed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tit166NS67c); it's the equivalent of understanding someone's joking because you saw a hint of a smile. The product of music and words together is a specific, dramatically nuanced telling of a story; and the cool part is that the best operas make you forget about the lines between talking and singing.\n\nBut perhaps it’s true that opera comes with [connotations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CEmP21mTvI) of stuffy old hat ladies and pretentious intermission chat. Don’t get me wrong; opera snobbery is despicable. It’s basically just negative thinking done by people who are less informed than they think they are. Just as bad are those die-hard purists, uppity bores, really; they’re the ones who freak out about new concepts for their favourite opera, or get scared of [pants roles with love interests](http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/02/22/terence-corcoran-la-demenza-dellopera/).\n\n> The best operas make you forget about the lines between talking and singing.\n\nBut the canon of operatic repertoire needs a fresh set of eyes. The historical significance of, say, Donizetti’s set of three operas about [three different queens](http://voices.yahoo.com/donizettis-three-queens-6557828.html), is lost on most people. But a great production of Anna Bolena could stand as a riveting piece of drama, even blind to the surrounding history. There remains the offence of great pieces set to bad productions; but, to analogize, you wouldn’t stop watching TV because the Fonz [jumped the shark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpraJYnbVtE).",

        "body": "Terence Corcoran, in his grossly closed-minded [article](http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/02/22/terence-corcoran-la-demenza-dellopera/) inspired by the COC’s 2013 production of _La clemenza di Tito_, found himself so distraught by the sight of two women kissing (that head-turning product of opera's \"pants role\" tradition) that he suggested we throw out all of opera with the bathwater. One of the article's commenters puts it well: “The works of Mozart, Verdi, Wagner and other composers can succeed without the procrustean attempts of directors who misdiagnose and mistreat both opera and its [audience](http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/02/23/todays-letters-is-modern-opera-a-travesty-or-an-evolving-living-art/).” Create a piece of art that is self-sustaining, and not reliant upon a ticket holder’s advance research on their Roman Emperors, Druid mythology or the function of a _da capo_ aria. Create characters that are so rich that we understand immediately their status onstage. Use musical and textual repetition, notoriously snooze-worthy devices of Baroque and bel canto opera, to really say [something new](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUPxGcHyVhg). This is theatre, for chrissake.\n\nMost importantly, if the piece doesn’t give its team of artists enough tools to create one of these self-sustaining, entertaining operas, let’s just not do it.\n\n> Go, go see some opera, be it magical or be it terrible.\n\nSo, what to do? Make sure audiences see good opera. What does that mean? The kind that starts with the music, and evolves. I know a wonderful opera director who maintains that Mozart was one of the great directors of history. So, yes, we’re over the concept production for its own sake. But we also need to make room for new pieces, pieces that work harder at creating not just a concept for a show that will catch the eye, but creating a piece that is simply entertaining in itself. For example, John Adams and Mark-Anthony Turnage write their operas about people like [J. Robert Oppenheimer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fJRoKlCroU) and [Anna Nicole Smith](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-47a8NQxN4). Bam, just like that, you’ve got the attention of both baby boomers and 90s kids. That’s a lot less white hair. I’m not saying that pieces about contemporary issues or celebrities should be written because they’ll be more interesting, especially if they don’t actually make a great protagonist onstage. But in terms of an audience sympathizing with a character, having a real human being with human motivation is a step up from some like, say, [Rusalka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tImMZLfHaE), the Czech water-sprite.\n\nThe operatically inclined youths running around Toronto are really putting out some amazing work. It’s some truly innovative stuff, coming from companies like [Against the Grain Theatre](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1dKGD8MBY8) and [Opera 5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sByZ_GjC7EY), and the rave reviews are plentiful. I mean, how much more contemporary could a production be than getting an invitation to Figaro and Susanna’s [wedding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c12lWwmu6M)?\n\nGo, go see some opera, be it magical or be it terrible. Go and watch someone tell a story with the sound of their voice. Go and grab a seat along the sides of the theatre and try to catch a lazy assistant stage manager standing in the wings. Go and simply marvel at what the singers, orchestra, conductor, all of them, can do, the sounds they can make. It takes a lifetime of work to do what they do, and it was all for the sake of making you feel something.",

Verdi comes off as a man of the people, while Wagner gets everyone thinking. The role of power seems to be polar between the two; Verdi makes heroes out of those who stood up to figures of power (think, Aida, Alfredo), and Wagner starts with heroes in the first place (think Siegfried, Lohengrin) Despite a few unnecessary reminders that Wagner wrote unfriendly things about the Jews, and that Verdi conversely wrote them a great [chorus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzCVhQb-UMY), it was an interesting chat that included listeners responses from social media.

        "body": "## Why do you sing?\n\nIt is all in the family.  Singers, performers and educators are what make up the majority of my family.  My mother is a trained singer and Artistic Director of Saskatoon Opera.  My father is a trained actor and both he and my mother teach in their respective fields. Most of my aunts, uncles and cousins are trained musicians and educators as well.  My uncle, Mel Braun, is head of Voice at the University of Manitoba and has been my teacher since I was 18\\.  In a sense, I did not know other professions were an option!\n\n## What's irresistible about opera?\n\nFrom a very early age I was drawn to opera.  When I was five years old we were living in the apartment attached to my grandparent’s house.  I was watching _Le nozze di Figaro_ on French CBC and my grandmother came in to tell me it was time for dinner.  I told her I would come to the table once the opera was over.  I was drawn to the emotions that the characters expressed through the sublime music they sang.  How in one moment the music has us laughing and in the next we are crying or it makes the hairs on the back of our necks stand on end.  How a performance has the ability to stay with us and draws up emotions that we did not know existed.  Opera is the only all encompassing performing art form bringing together the forces of hundreds of people to present one piece of drama.  It is completely awe-inspiring and every experience is unique.  I believe that it is why it is such an addictive experience.  One will feel and react differently every time we see an opera, as our state of being will be indicative as to how it moves our souls.\n\n## What do you think are the reasons you've become successful in the operatic industry?\n\nIt is all about hard work.  To be successful in any profession one must work hard and I believe opera is no different.  I will say, that it takes hard work in all aspects of the career.  Obviously, one must work hard at singing and the technique of if but we also must have a working knowledge of multiple languages, be an actor, and be physically fit.  There is also the business side to managing one’s career; making and maintaining contacts and all of the secretarial type work of answering emails, arranging travel and accommodation.  It is many careers combined in to one!\n\n## Do you have any dream roles? Ones that you hope to sing, and ones you know you'll never touch?\n\nBrünnhilde, Tosca, Turandot – I hope these roles are in my future!   When I was younger I always wanted to be a soubrette and to sing Susanna, Zerlina, Despina, etc.  It always seemed like those roles would be so much FUN!!\n\n## What have your professional highlights been thus far?\n\nSinging Elettra in the Ensemble Studio Performance of _Idomeneo_ in my second year of Ensemble.  It was the first time the Ensemble had been given the opportunity to sing a main stage performance and it was a very exciting!  Most recently, singing Leonore in _Fidelio_ with Michigan Opera Theatre was a dream come true.  I have loved the opera, and role, ever since I saw Adrianne Pieczonka sing it at the COC in my first year of Ensemble.  I hope it is a role I have the opportunity to sing many more times.  Another highlight has been, of course, returning to the COC to sing Ellen Orford opposite Ben Heppner.  What a huge thrill!\n\n## If you pursued another profession, what would it be?\n\nTo supplement my income between contracts I travel with and nanny for dear friends of mine who are also both opera singers.  I love being with kids.  They teach us a tremendous amount about being in the moment and enjoying life and being a nanny brings me a lot of joy.  I know I would pursue a profession that would involve working with kids, most likely, being an educator.\n\n## What's it like performing an opera in your native language?\n\nIt is not as easy as one may think!   When one is singing in a foreign language we spend a lot of time preparing our scores; translating each word, creating a poetic translation, taking the time to really sing each vowel and syllable correctly.  When singing in our native language we sometimes skip some of these steps so I’ve really had to treat English as a foreign language and work the text as if it was in German or Italian.\n\n## What can young singers do to maintain opera's cultural relevance?\n\nWe have to be cheerleaders for our art form and break down the stereotypes that exist.  The stories that are told in opera are incredibly relevant, especially in two that the COC produced in 2013\\.  _Peter Grimes_ is a social commentary on being an outsider and feeling bullied and misunderstood.  _La bohème_ is about the trials and tribulations surrounding being in love.  I think these are both topics most of us deal with on a daily basis.\n\n## What do you strive to achieve during a performance?\n\nTo communicate the story we are telling to the best of my ability to the audience who has come to experience it.  I always have smaller, more technical goals for each performance but overall I want to tell a story.\n\n## Guilty pleasure of choice?\n\nWatching Reality TV!\n\n## Coffee or tea?\n\nTea.\n\n## What's next for you?\n\nI moved to Germany right after I finished _Peter Grimes_ at the COC.  I will be spending the next year in the country learning the language and auditioning.  I have contracts that I will bring me back to North America over the next couple of seasons but Germany will be my home base for the foreseeable future.\n\n<div class=\"intro\" dir=\"ltr\">For news and other details about Ileana, visit her website at [www.ileanamontalbetti.com](www.ileanamontalbetti.com).</div>",

        "body": "There is this fascinating relationship between opera and the Muppets.  Considering that The Muppet Show follows the blueprint of the classic [revue show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revue), it’s not that odd; revues are built on sophisticated satire of anyone or anything famous at the time.  Most of the guests were actors and/or musicians, including  Alan Arkin, Gilda Radner, Steve Martin, Johnny Cash, Ethel Merman, John Cleese, Alice Cooper and Chewbacca. And honestly, if Chewie gets to grace the Muppet stage with his noble howl, so does Placido Domingo.\n\nYou know you've made it big in the opera industry when you make it on the Muppets. This impressive roster of opera singers who have appeared with the Muppets, either on _Sesame Street_ or _The Muppet Show_, confirms that. Check it out: Marilyn Horne, Samuel Ramey, Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras, Isabel Leonard, [Renee Fleming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPdP7XJdvlM&list=PLCA505947EEDEB20A), [Victor Borge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5iCVytIbmk) and [Denyce Graves](http://http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZFmNJjv1LM) have all serenaded a puppet or two.

Miss Piggy's rendition of [\"La ci darem la mano\"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-5lBpkEC6I) (_Don Giovanni_) shows she's not picky about her duet partner (can I get a Zerlina up in here?)\n\nAnd, I mean, how could you not love a Beaker-Swedish Chef-Bizet mash-up?\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXKUb5A1auM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nInteresting factoid: Jim Henson knew and had worked with Maurice Sendak, illustrator for the how-could-you-not-love-this children’s book, _[Where the Wild Things Are](http://www.amazon.com/Where-Wild-Things-Maurice-Sendak/dp/0064431789)_. Sendak actually adapted the book into a libretto for an [opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are_(opera)) by the same name, written by Oliver Knussen as half of a double-bill with another adaptation of Sendak’s, _Higglety Pigglety Pop! Or, There Must Be More to Life_. (Both available on Rdio [here](http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/oliver-knussen-higglety-pigglety-pop%21-where-the-wild-things-are-mr0002515520).) Jim Henson even went to Glyndebourne to go see the double-bill, as well as a production of Prokofiev’s _The Love of Three Oranges_ for which Sendak had worked as a designer.\n\nThe small but significant connection was between Jim Henson and Maurice Sendak. Sendak, known best as the worked at the Children’s Television Workshop during the development stages of _Sesame Street_, and Henson was around because some of his beloved Muppets were going to become part of _Sesame Street_’s cast. The two of them collaborated on childrens' programs like [_Seven Little Monsters_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoTnbw_YjJU) and [_Bumble Ardy_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qh4xoEf9wE). Sendak had worked in the operatic industry as a [designer](http://glyndebourne.com/product/maurice-sendak-collection) (for Glyndebourne’s 1982 production of _Love for Three Oranges_, no less) and as a [librettist](http://glyndebourne.com/where-wild-things-are) for Oliver Knussen’s operatic setting of, you guessed it, _Where the Wild Things Are_. And Jim Henson even [went to Glyndebourne](http://www.henson.com/jimsredbook/2012/06/10/6101982/) to see it.\n\nSo I envision at the very least, as the _Sesame Street _suits at the [Children’s Television Workshop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Workshop) meet around the big conference table the corner office, someone must have vouched for opera as a great point of satire. And that's why we have this:\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8DNwXGqQCN4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>",

        "body": "Ah, classical music. Old-fashioned to the bone. It's almost charming, except we still need to write articles about the plight of the female conductor and the female composer. Young Russian conductor Vasily Petrenko basically said that the male players in the orchestra wouldn't be able to control themselves if they had to look up at the podium and see a pretty lady there. According to Petrenko, male conductors “often have [less sexual energy](http://www.newsinenglish.no/2013/08/30/new-conductor-strikes-sour-note/) and can focus more on the music. A sweet girl on the podium can make one’s thoughts drift towards something else.”\n\nNow, [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/arts/music/female-conductors-search-for-equality-at-highest-level.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0&adxnnlx=1387818731-MV22wdovixjQ4sCcfKjqTA) is slightly optimistic, and echoes a few feelings I've had on the subject of women conductors. There may be something to the idea that conducting doesn't appeal to women as much as it does to men. Perhaps the desire to be a conductor comes from a drive for podium power, or the thrill of inspiring a mass of people. Or maybe they're just after attention. But maybe these are also masculine tendencies, and maybe women just don't feel like playing that role in their careers.\n\nBut it still stands that women's presence in classical music is comparatively rare. The Metropolitan Opera just had its third female conductor make her debut last week. Jane Glover, I tip my hat to you, especially since you had to conduct that lame \"family friendly,\" a.k.a., \"huge cuts were made\" version of _The Magic Flute_. In its [2016-17](http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2013/10/News/Met_New_Works.html) season, the Met will bring in its fourth lady of the podium, Susanna Mälkki, to conduct Kaija Saariaho's _L'amour de loin_.\n\nSimilarly to the world of conducting, the proportions of female composers are slowly creeping up. The Met's _L'amour de loin_ will not only feature its fourth (FOURTH!) _maestra_, but also the second (SECOND!) performance of an opera written by a female composer. The first was in 1903\\. [Nineteen-oh-three](http://archives.metoperafamily.org/imgs/DerWald.htm)! It was _Der Wald_, by [Ethel Smyth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Smyth), an English composer, and the reviews from the _premiére_ are hilarious:\n\n\"After an hour of ultra-modern music, strident, formless, passionate music that stirred the blood with clangor of brass, the shrieks of strings, the plaint of wood winds and disdained to woo the senses with flower-soft melodic phrase, the audience at the Metropolitan Opera House clamored for the composer and held its breath when she appeared. A fragile creature, feminine to her fingertips in rather old-fashioned gown of black silk, red roses in her dark hair and a courtesy like grandmother used to make… She was Ethel M. Smyth, a young Englishwoman, whose one-act opera, Der Wald, had just received its first American presentation….\"\n\nProgress.\n\nI found a neat talk about the idea that women can't paint or do anything else creative.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K29geX4uN9w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nAnd as much as I love him, Christopher Hitchens maintained that [women aren't funny](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/01/hitchens200701).\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7izJggqCoA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>",

Composer [Dan Visconti](http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/the-audience-is-the-most-important-instrument/) writes about a paradox that exists between a composer's freedom to experiment with contemporary music, and the need for the music itself to be heard. For example, anyone who studied music in university or college knows of The U of Anything Contemporary Music Concert, or the U of Whatever Student Composer's Concert. These concerts can turn out some frustrating material, the kind that's self-indulgent, boring, awkward-giggle-inducing, and apathetic to its audience. They also often have a sparse audience turn-out. It happens when a composer bites his thumb at the listener's experience. Not many people are willing to hear music by a composer who convinces himself that his music was not meant to be understood or felt by an audience. This kind of martyrdom can cost a composer a chance to really connect with his audience and say something with sound.\nContemporary composers who pride themselves on obscuring the listener's understanding of the piece also tend to obscure the chance of someone even hearing it. They're like Rob, Dick and Barry at Championship Vinyl (_High Fidelity_, and you should have seen this movie by now): they liked the music they liked _because_ it was obscure and unavailable (and maybe less good?).  Remember how they berated customers both behind their backs and to their faces about their \"obvious\" record choices? And remember how Rob complained that they weren't selling any records in the store because Dick and Barry were being elitist and mean?\n\nSo, the composer's goal is to be humble enough to listen to the wants and necessary catharsis of his audience. I hope that this is what's happening with the COC's commission of _Hadrian_, set to have its _première_ in the company's 2018-19 season. With music by Rufus Wainwright and libretto by playwright Daniel MacIvor, it's built up a good amount of hype already. It's well-deserved hype, partly because _Hadrian_ will be the COC's first commission in almost 15 years. The COC's General Director Alexander Neef has great [things to say](http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/rufus-wainwright-daniel-macivor-creating-hadrian-opera-for-coc-1.2447886) about his intention and criteria for choosing _Hadrian_, and both Wainwright and MacIvor [speak encouragingly](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/Hadrian.aspx#rufus) on what makes an opera and its story great.\n\nI look forward to a brand new opera that puts bums in seats, and a composer who thinks about reception. That excites me, so don't let me down, Rufus.",

Here are a few to which I look forward.\n\nLater this month in Madrid, _Brokeback Mountain_ has its debut at the [Teatro Real](http://www.teatro-real.com/en/espectaculos/1774). It was originally supposed to have its première at New York City Opera, but it got nixed in 2008 when NYCO's general director Gerard Mortier resigned (he later brought it with him to Madrid). It's written by American composer Charles Wuorinen and Annie Proulx, the author of the [original short story](http://www.taosmemory.com/oscar/BrokebackMountainNovle.pdf) on which the movie was based.\nOut of curiosity and shameless fandom, I profess an honest excitement for _[Breaking Bad - Ozymandias](http://www.classicfm.com/music-news/latest-news/breaking-bad-opera-premiere-2014/)_, a new work by composer-conductor Sung Jin Hong set to première on January 28, 2014 as part of the One World Symphony's \"Addiction\" concert series in New York City. There's been talk of having Bryan Cranston involved and performing in _Sprechstimme_.\n\nTapestry Opera is Canada's go-to company for producing new Canadian opera, and their next project is _M'dea Undone_ (music by John Harris, libretto by Marjorie Chan) is set to première in the spring of 2015\\. This year, on April 4 and 5, Tapestry presents Tapestry Explorations, a collection of short and/or workshopping operas still in process. I suspect that _M'dea Undone_ will be part of the workshop this April. I love going to see Tapestry's workshop performances; if you're like me and enjoy seeing how something is put together, this is a really unique and honest artistic experience in a really cool performance space. Check out their [schedule for 2014](https://tapestryopera.com/2013-2014-season).\n\nMore from Canada, albeit more of a wait, is Opéra de Montréal's commission [_Les feluettes_](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2013/12/16/opera-de-montreal-commissions-new-opera-based-on-lilies-for-2016-premiere/) (Lilies), set to open in 2016\\. Based on Quebec playwright Michel Marc Bouchard's play of the same name, it's an adaptation by the author with music by Australian composer Kevin March. _Les feluettes_ will be the first new piece by OdeM since 2001's _Thérèse Raquin_.\n\nShortly after Montréal makes its mark with its new Canadian opera, the Canadian Opera Company will debut the much-anticipated [_Hadrian_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/Hadrian.aspx). It'll all go down in the fall of 2018: Rufus Wainwright, Daniel MacIvor, and plenty of ancient Roman juicy goings-on. I'll be there with bells on.\n\nIn mid-March, 2014, [_Bum Phillips_](http://bumphillipsopera.com/about/) will open in New York City. It's a new work about a football coach who seems to be quite American indeed; the cool part of this project is that it's been supported in part by [crowdfunding campaigns](http://houston.culturemap.com/news/sports/07-10-13-the-bum-phillips-opera-is-taking-shape-yes-this-crazy-concept-needs-to-happen/).\n\nThere's also Ricky Ian Gordon's _[A Coffin in Egypt](https://www.houstongrandopera.org/Site/tickets/calendar/view.aspx?PerfId=2267)_, also premiering in March 2014 at Houston Grand Opera, written for Frederica von Stade and apparently a [must-see](http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwopera/article/Houston-Grand-Opera-to-Launch-2014-With-Three-World-Premieres-American-Premiere-and-More-20131217).  Mark Adamo's \"[Holiday Opera](http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2013/11/News/Dallas_Opera_Mark_Adamo.html)\" will be completed for Dallas Opera in  December 2015. Oh, oh, and Minnesota Opera's [_The Shining_](http://www.mnopera.org/season/2015-2016/the-shining/)! May, 2016!\n\nWhew. Go see some opera.",

        "body": "George Carlin said on playing the blues, \"I'll tell you a little secret about the blues: it's not enough to know which notes to play, you have to know why they need to be played.\"\n\nAlmost on par with calling _Phantom of the Opera_ an opera is the offence in the form of pseudo-opera singers, often too young, that flood TV shows like _America/Britain/Holland's Got Talent_. Little girls and boys under 10 years old stand on a big stage and warble out Puccini hits (it's always \"Nessun dorma\" or \"O mio babbino caro\"). It's infuriating and it makes me stress eat.\nFor example, both Jackie Evancho, 10 (_America's Got Talent_), and Amira Willighagen, 9 (_Holland's Got Talent_), belted out \"O mio babbino caro\" to roars of applause. And on YouTube, these kids can do no wrong:\n\nIt must be true that the fans of this child singers think that in order to be a good musician, one either has \"got it\" or hasn't. If you asked them to define \"it,\" I bet you'd hear some reference to a \"natural flair\" or that their child has \"star quality\" or is \"very musical.\" You know, as a young pianist who had a natural knack for all things musical, I eventually figured out that when my teacher told me I was \"very musical,\" it inevitably led to a lecture about the details I'd forgotten, the time I hadn't spent teaching my fingers to be strong and efficient and accurate. It took awareness that talent only got me to Pretty Good; I knew I had it in me to be Great, and took on the workload to do so.\n\nThat's why I say the public assumption must be that musical talent is something you're born with, and therefore never have to work hard at. Anyone who's attempted music-making as an adult knows the enormous amount of dedicated hard work and active practice involved. The irony is that professional musicians work their entire lives to produce something that sounds organic, improvised and emotionally inspired. We know that some people are born with more musical intuition than others, but simple talent is useless without technique.\n\nSpeaking of being useless, [Dr. Glenn Winters](http://dropera.blogspot.ca/2012/01/about-those-child-opera-singers-heres.html?fb_action_ids=10152443578425166&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_source=other_multiline&action_object_map=%5B10150461126021517%5D&action_type_map=%5B%22og.likes%22%5D&action_ref_map=%5B%5D) makes an excellent case for keeping children out of opera.  Child opera singers are a smash hit with TV talent shows, but are of utterly no value to professional musicians. \"It's apery; it's mimicry; it's the result of carefully imitating some adult's interpretation, be it from the teacher or some recording.  Musical compositions which express profound insights about love, loss and life are beyond the ken of a nine year old and that's just how it is.  Having a good ear is not the same thing as musical insight.\"\n\nAnd in terms of vocal technique, renowned Canadian voice teacher Wendy Nielsen puts it bluntly: \"many of these kids trying to mimic an adult sound are simply depressing the larynx by holding down their tongue.\"\n\nHow about you take a few minutes, bite down on a piece of leather, and judge for yourselves? Oh, and I did not purposefully try to find these two girls singing O Mio Babs. It just happened that way.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBDtbl3glr0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKhmFSV-XB0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>",

Seattle Opera suffered large cutbacks in order to stay alive, and the Minnesota Orchestra's standoff with the board has cost them at least a season and a half. And although outside of our stated calendar year, Canadians certainly felt this week's closure of Opera Hamilton.\n\n[Italy struggles as well](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/news/lend-us-a-tenor-italian-opera-houses-in-need-of-funding-9047413.html), with only three houses in the country currently able to pay their bills: the Teatre Regio in Turin, Venice's Teatro la Fenice and, of course, La Scala. Across the pond, restrictive unions and mismanagement of the companies result in bankrupt houses and lower regulated fees for artists.\n\nThe theme in common? A poor business model. Says [Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/arts/music/lessons-in-a-year-of-crises.html?_r=0): \"Any institution, big or small, old or new, must have a clear artistic vision, a purpose that connects with audiences and the community. But the performing arts have never been profit-making endeavors. It is more important than ever that all institutions, from a fledgling string quartet to the lofty Metropolitan Opera, have an effective business model.\"\n\n> Of all the noises known to man, opera is the most expensive. (Molière)\n\nThe solution seems to be simple: don't put on too many shows in a season, and don't try to grow more quickly than the market demands. Two success stories of moderation in America are the [Riverside Symphony](http://www.riversidesymphony.org/) and [Gotham Chamber Opera](http://www.gothamchamberopera.org/), both with sparse seasons full of quality that attract a legitimate returning audience.\nIn Canada, I see one of those sparks in [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/shows). With two or three productions a season, intimate and refreshing performance spaces (not to mention cheaper than a 1500-seat theatre), and small artistic and creative teams, AtG is focusing on creating productions that warrant attention on their own. Cost-efficiency plus a good product equals profit, right? Am I being naïve?",

As of Sunday, the event has been etched into Internet stone, and even a Canadian can [watch it](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365143463/).\n\nAnd what a joy to watch. [Riccardo Frizza](http://www.riccardofrizza.com/) conducts a night of seriously top-notch opera from the who's-who of today's stars. Audra McDonald hosts, the singers wear the _good_ dresses, and Susan Graham dances with soldiers. It's the kind of event that makes me itch for backstage access. _And PBS gives it to you!_\n\nMezzo-soprano [Isabel Leonard](http://isabelleonard.com/) is featured as the 2013 winner of the Richard Tucker Award, and shows us all exactly why with some of the most polished, visceral and exciting singing of the evening.\n\nTenor [Stephen Costello](http://stephencostellotenor.com/) and soprano [Ailyn Pérez](http://ailynperez.com/) (both past winners of the Richard Tucker Award) loosen up the audience as Nemorino and Adina; they both sing effortlessly and the performance is nothing charm. They're an operatic power couple. Her dress is great, so are his shoes. Life is good.\n\nCostello return to sing us an aria from _Faust_, \"Salut! Demeure chaste et pure\". His singing is bright and thoughtful, a hard combination to pull off for a still-young tenor.\n\nTenor Matthew Polenzani makes me love \"Kleinzach\" from _Les contes d'Hoffmann_. His singing grabbed me right in the feels; his steely voice was malleable, and when he skirts around the limits (an easy thing to do with this aria), I love it. Polenzani wins the unexpected-thrill-of-the-night.\n\nSoprano Angela Meade raises my heart rate with some Power Verdi with \"Tu al cui sguardo onnipossente\" from _I due foscari_. Stamina and soul, this lady has. And an awesome high-C face.\n\nAnd of course there's the utterly superhuman Joyce DiDonato. She sang the bejeezus out of \"Tanti affetti\" from Rossini's _La donna del lago_; she made me realize that Rossini's endless and redundant V-I cadences at the ends of his arias actually work when they're half blended in with raging applause. Also, my favourite dress of the night. Way to go, Joyce.\n\nAnd there's just stuff you can't _see_ anywhere else, like Greer Grimsley and Stephanie Blythe singing Samson and Delilah, or Renée Fleming's fascinating shawl.\n\nSo, yeah, I liked the whole Richard Tucker Centennial shabang, and I think you should watch it if you haven't yet. It's truly excellent singing from the gamut of today's opera giants, and a smorgasbord of inspiration for young singers. If you ever needed motivation to practice, jump straight to 1:37:41.\n\nWatch the whole thing [here](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365143463/). I give it five thingies out of five. If you've seen it, give us your best critique in the comments.",

The study found that 10 minutes of Mozart improved the spatial reasoning skills of college students and rats, and 10 minutes of piano or singing lessons did the same for preschoolers. And so the \"Mozart effect\" became known in education and parenting circles as [\"Mozart makes my kid smart.\"](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/12/will-mozart-make-child-smarter-classical-music-iq)\n\nAnd then there were [other studies](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/documents/BJSP,%20Mozart%20Effect.pdf) done that suggested the improvements were actually pretty small. The difference in IQ in the children exposed to Mozart and those who weren't was just a few points. I suppose the logical next step would be to use these negative findings in debates over the value of music education in public schools. Great.\n\nI think the flaw is in asking whether or not or exposing your kid to classical music will make him intelligent. Intelligence is arguable, and brains work differently; I realize I'm being very broad, but it's only because I don't think there's a debate to be had here. If you give a child a chance to study music, it means they're either singing or learning an instrument. In either process, that child will learn aural skills, learn to read music (basically learning to read a large series of patterns), gain hand-eye co-ordination and fine motor skills, and learn self-discipline and time management. If you continue music education into secondary and post-secondary school, that list grows to include learning foreign languages, poetry analysis, musical and dramatic theory, and lots and lots of literature.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you define as \"intelligent.\" These skills are undeniably a product of music education, and they're valuable. Taking kids to concerts will create balance with TV. Taking a kids to piano lessons will complement their soccer games. I don't know if it makes them smarter, but it will give them more scope of what kind of people exist in the world and how they spend their energy.\n\nI like what Mark Tinkler, artistic director of [English Pocket Opera Company](http://www.epoc.co/), [has to say](http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/jan/14/arts-mark-tinkler-english-pocket-opera) about the whole thing.",

        "body": "“I’m particularly proud that the 14/15 season is comprised entirely of productions owned or co-owned by the COC. Our three new productions have been created with the world’s best opera companies and the three revivals are essential pieces in the company’s history. Ultimately, an all-COC season reflects the new artistic paradigm we’re in, in the consistency and quality of our works.”  - Alexander Neef, Canadian Opera Company General Director.\n\nYesterday the Canadian Opera Company announced its 2014/15 season. Let's jump right in:\nFirst up: _Falstaff_, directed by Robert Carsen (_Dialogues des Carmélites, Iphigénie en Tauride, Orfeo)_ and conducted by COC Music Director Johannes Debus. This production is shared between the COC, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Netherlands Opera, Teatro alla Scala and the Metropolitan Opera to enthusiastic reviews. The cast is spectacular: Juno-award winning Canadian baritone Gerald Finley sings the title role, flanked by fellow Canadian baritone Russell Braun in the role of Ford. The two wives are played by South African soprano Amanda Echalaz (Alice Ford) and South African-Canadian mezzo-soprano Lauren Segal, a graduate of the COC Ensemble Studio. Marie-Nicole Lemieux sings Mistress Quickly, Simone Osborne will be a charming Nannetta, and Frédéric Antoun will no doubt have my heart as Fenton. _Falstaff_ opens October 3, 2014 for 7 shows.\n\nPaired with _Falstaff_ the fall of 2014 will bring the COC's production of Puccini's _Madama Butterfly_. The program is almost 24 years old, by Brian MacDonald, with lighting by Michael Whitfield and set/costume design by Susan Benson. This revival will feature young German conductor Patrick Lange at the podium, and the role of Cio-Cio San will be shared by Patricia Racette and Kelly Kaduce.  After seeing Racette's Butterfly in the [2009 Metropolitan HD Broadcast](http://www.metoperafamily.org/ondemand/catalog/search/results/index.aspx?keyword=madama+butterfly), I agree that she will “rightly stand among the great Butterflies of her era” (_Opera News_), and [Kaduce](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/arts/music/27butterfly.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1389845017-F+sBqadvLgS+aVp0gMmRsw)'s powerful performance at Santa Fe Opera “demolishes stereotypes. This is no conventional Butterfly-as-victim, but a woman of consequence” (_Santa Fe Reporter_). Two Italian tenors [Stefano Secco](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7XXsGe9g2c) and [Andrea Carè](http://http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc7PwJoLKIc) share the role of Pinkerton, and from what I hear, we'll get some seriously good, seriously Italian _legato_. We'll see two Sharplesses as well, the role shared by American baritone Dwayne Croft and Canada's Gregory Dahl. American mezzo-soprano Elizabeth DeShong will sing the role of Suzuki. _Madama Butterfly_ opens October 10, 2013 for 12 shows.\n\nThe winter season brings a classic: Mozart's _Don Giovanni_. It's a COC co-production with Teatro Real Madrid, Festival d'Aix-en-Provence and the Bolshoi Theatre, directed by by Moscow-born Dmitri Tcherniakov and conducted by Michael Hofstetter. This cast is serious: Canadian baritone Russell Braun takes on the title role, and Nova Scotian soprano/superhero Jane Archibald sings Donna Anna. Tenor Michael Schade brings us more Mozart in the guise of Don Ottavio, and Donna Elvira is sung by American mezzo-soprano Jennifer Holloway. Kyle Ketelsen will sing Leporello, and I'm [excited](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkFEKU_BUBw) about it. _Don Giovanni_ opens January 24, 2015 for 10 shows.\n\nNext up is Atom Egoyan's _Die Walküre_, designed by Michael Levine, and conducted by maestro Johannes Debus. This COC production was first presented in 2004 and then in 2006 as part of the COC's _Ring Cycle_, which rang in the opening of the Four Seasons Centre. American soprano [Christine Goerke](http://www.christinegoerke.com/) will debut the role of Brünnhilde, and tenor [Clifton Forbis](http://www.cami.com/?webid=157) will sing Siegmund, returning after his ravely reviewed performance in the production's debut. Danish baritone Johan Reuter will make his COC debut as Wotan, and Sieglinde will be sung by American soprano Heidi Melton, \"the Wagnerian voice we have bee waiting for since Flagstad and Nilsson.\" _Die Walküre_ opens on January 31, 2015, for 7 shows.\n\nOn the lighter side of opera, Spanish theatre group [Els Comediants](http://comediants.com/?lang=en) presents a new COC co-production with Houston Grand Opera, Opéra National de Bordeaux and Opera Australia: Rossini's _Il barbiere di Siviglia._ Els Comediants delighted audiences with _La cenerentola_ in 2011; if anyone remembers the incredible beehive wigs and oversize sets, you remember how it fit Rossini's comedy like a glove. The famed barber himself will be sung by Canadian baritone Joshua Hopkins, “an outstanding young baritone with a virile, vigorous yet velvety sound and an immediately evident dramatic authority” (_Globe and Mail_). American tenor Alek Shrader (anyone seen _The Audition?_) will sing Count Almaviva, and the role of Rosina will be shared by two exciting young mezzos: Italian [Serena Malfi](http://www.serenamalfi.com/) and American [Cecelia Hall](http://www.cami.com/?webid=2270). On the podium is Scottish-born conductor Rory MacDonald, whom we saw lead _Carmen_ in 2010.\n\n_Il barbiere di Siviglia_ will also be the choice for the Ensemble Studio performance of the 2014/15 season. Casting is still TBA, but these performances are always an event not to be missed (and usually cheaper!). The run of _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ will be sung in Italian, and begins April 17, 2015 for 13 shows. The Ensemble Studio performance is scheduled for May 15, 2015.\n\nAnd finally we reach what I'm sure will be one of the most anticipated productions of the season: the COC's double-bill of Béla Bartók's _Bluebeard's Castle_ and Arnold Schoenberg's _Erwartung_. This production by Robert LePage premiered in 1993, establishing the COC as one of the world's most innovative and exciting companies. Set and costume design is by Michael Levine and lighting design is by David Finn. _Bluebeard's Castle_ will star Canada's great villain John Relyea and Russian mezzo Ekaterina Gubanova, whom we'll see this spring as Dulcinée in the COC's _Don Quichotte_. _Erwartung_ features the fantastic Krisztina Szabó as the Woman. The double-bill will be conducted by Johannes Debus, his first time with both pieces. _Bluebeard's Castle/Erwartung_ opens for 7 shows on May 6, 2015.\n\nWhew! So we've got nothing but COC productions, tons of Canadian artists, and what I think is a curious mix of styles in this upcoming season. Congratulations, Mr. Neef.",

[Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/) is partnering with the Banff Centre for the Arts and the Canadian Opera Company to premiere a new opera training program! Led by AtG's artistic director Joel Ivany and music director Christopher Mokrzewski, eight singers will have the chance to workshop operatic skills in an innovative way. They'll collaborative on Mozart's _Don Giovanni_  (with an Against-the-Grain-twist, to be sure), and present it at various venues within the Banff community.\n\n“This residency demonstrates something heartening,” said Christopher Mokrzewski. “Two of the most established and respected cultural institutions in Canada — which already employ innovative and creative thinking of their own — are willing to support the development of an indie opera company that occasionally turns convention on its head. This shows vision, confidence and a true commitment to the vitality of the artform. I’m chuffed!”\n\nGuest faculty and instructors will include the COC's [Alexander Neef](http://www.coc.ca/aboutthecoc/alexanderneef/Bio.aspx) and [Johannes Debus](http://www.coc.ca/aboutthecoc/companymembers/Orchestra/JohannesDebus.aspx), world-class playwright Daniel MacIvor ([_Hadrian_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/Hadrian.aspx), anyone?), pianist/conductor Stephen Hargreaves, and legendary Canadian mezzo-soprano Judith Forst.\n\n“This is a significant moment for AtG, as we share our work with a broader audience with the help of The Banff Centre, and in partnership with the Canadian Opera Company,\" said Joel Ivany. “The _Open Space_ program will stretch us in new ways, which is crucial for a young company, especially one as independent as ours. I couldn’t be more excited and proud to partner with these two organizations. We're doing something different and important. I can't wait to collaborate with the young artists who will participate in our program.”\n\nI'm excited! Are you excited? Let us know in the comments below.

Soprano Karine Boucher, tenor Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure and bass-baritone Iain MacNeil were selected out of nine finalists who competed in the third annual Ensemble Studio Competition in November 2013\\. Karine, Jean-Philippe and Iain were the top three prize winners at the competition, the feature event of _[Centre Stage](http://http://www.coc.ca/SupportTheCOC/SpecialEvents/CentreStage.aspx)_, the COC's first Ensemble Studio Competition Gala. In addition to these talented new young artists, the Ensemble Studio welcomes pianist Jennifer Szeto.\nThe Ensemble Studio is Canada's most illustrious program for young singers and pianists, offering experience through performance and understudying of mainstage roles, language and acting studies, and coaching with the best people in the industry.

At the COC's [Free Concert Series in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre](http://www.coc.ca/performancesandtickets/freeconcertseries.aspx) (an incredibly diverse series not to be missed) you can hear these young singers and pianists in recital.\n\nSo, who are these newbies?\n\nBorn in Québec City, soprano [Karine Boucher](http://karineboucher.com/) is the first prize and audience-choice award winner of the COC’s 2013 Ensemble Studio Competition with her stunning and poised singing of \"Piangerò la sorte mia\" (she had my vote!). Boucher is a graduate of the [Atelier lyrique de l’Opéra de Montréal](http://www.operademontreal.com/en/emerging-artists/atelier-lyrique). She studied at the Québec Conservatory, and is a grant recipient of the Jacqueline Desmarais Foundation. In 2011 she was a regional finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions.

Originally from Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, he studied at the University of Montreal. Jean-Philippe has participated in young artist training programs with the National Arts Centre, Centre d’Arts Orford and Académie Internationale d’été Nice.

A native of Brockville, Ontario, MacNeil studied at the University of Toronto and Dalhousie University. Credits include Figaro in _Le nozze di Figaro_, Bobby in Kurt Weill’s _Mahagonny-Songspiel_, Sweeney Todd in _Sweeney Todd,_ Brewer in _Comedy on the Bridge_ and Tom/John in _The Face on the Barroom Floor_ (Dalhousie Opera Workshop).

Jennifer is a graduate of Atelier Lyrique de l’Opéra de Montréal and studied at McGill University. In 2012, she was an Emerging Artist with the Green Mountain Opera Festival in Vermont and, in Toronto, played for the Metro Youth Opera’s production of Donizetti’s _L’elisir d’amore_. For Opera McGill, she served as répétiteur for Britten’s _The Turn of the Screw_, Mozart’s _Don Giovanni_ and Puccini’s _La bohème_. Other recent engagements include presenting one-act operas in English at the 2012 Halifax Summer Opera Workshop. In 2011 she attended the prestigious Franz Schubert Institute in Austria and served as music director for the Metro Youth Opera Company’s production of _Così fan tutte_.\n\nSo, a grand welcome, new Ensemblers! You are in for a season of big names, big audiences, big experiences and big friendships. I am excited on your behalves.\n\nAre you a fan of the COC's young artists? Are you one of them?

And as if the triumvirate gods of Opera, Internet and Day-Of-Week united forces for bored opera-lovers everywhere, the Metropolitan Opera put up its 1988 production of _Ariadne auf Naxos._ Directed by Bodo Igesz, the production features James Levine, Kathleen Battle, Jessye Norman, Tatiana Troyanos and Nico Castel. That's right, _Nico Castel_ performs the role of the Haushofmeister. Now, I've seen the DVD of this production before, mostly because it comes with a short documentary showing rehearsal footage with maestro Levine, Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle. It's fascinating to see moments of conversation between conductor and singer, especially when you can catch glimpses of young Barbara Bonney and Dawn Upshaw as Najade and Echo.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BN1tmtFPibg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oj-o7TbGCek\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nIf you're not already a subscriber to Met Opera on Demand, it's at least worth their [7-day free trial offer](https://www.metoperafamily.org/ondemand/index.aspx?utm_source=sitegraphics&utm_medium=wlbucket&utm_campaign=mood).

So I'm _Masked-Ball_-hopping, watching about three different versions at once at the moment. In the foreground is the classic Moshinsky production from the Met in 1980, with Pavarotti, Ricciarelli, Berini, and Canada's beloved Louis Quilico as Renato. Here he is being a Verdi baritone:\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2XNCdRQe0SE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nAnd to keep things fresh, I'm watching with rapt curiosity the Met's recent broadcast of _Ballo. _It's from December 2012, and the cast is pretty stellar: Sondra Radvanovsky, Marcelo Álvarez, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Stephanie Blythe, and a goateed Kathleen Kim. The production is David Alden's; I'm always curious to see work by both David and Christopher Alden, since they always seem to wear their hearts on their sleeves as they communicate with their audience. Some of the singing doesn't do it for me (Stephanie Blythe's chest-voice/head-voice cutoff point stresses me out), and some of the direction looks a bit hokey (it's a problem when you film something meant to be seen from afar). But it's eye-candy for opera-lovers, and if you're in the industry, you can be kept busy catching a glimpse of your opera friend So-And-So in the chorus or singing small roles. Hi, [Keith Miller](http://www.keithmillerbass.com/)! It's worth another look at that Met Opera on Demand free trial I've been nagging about.\n\nThe production coming to the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/UnBalloInMaschera/CastAndCreativeTeam.aspx) looks exciting in both musical and artistic terms. I always love seeing [Adrianne Pieczonka](http://www.adriannepieczonka.com/) onstage, and I'm curious to have another listen to both tenor Dmitri Pittas and mezzo-soprano Elena Manistina. I remember Elena being a no-holds-barred Azucena in the COC's _Il trovatore_ in 2012, and Pittas was impressive as the Duke in _Rigoletto_ in 2011\\. It could be a loud night.\n\nCanadian soprano [Simone Osborne](https://twitter.com/SimoneOsborne) will sing the role of Oscar, and it's something I'm looking forward to seeing. Simone has sung her fair share of feminine roles on the COC stage (Gilda, Pamina, Lauretta, Musetta), and I feel like she also has a secret knack for playing a guy. Here she is with fellow Canadian singer Adrianne Pieczonka as they anticipate the production's opening:\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_MOwDo-_ZA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nThe production is by Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito, and it's already impressed audiences at the Berliner Staatsoper. At the podium will be maestro Stephen Lord, who will no doubt bring the music and libretto together to create the most organic kind of drama. [Here](http://schmopera.com/stephen-lord-on-singers-on-bel-canto-and-on-theatre/), he talks with us about conducting singers and working in a theatrical genre of music.\n\nThe COC's _Un ballo in maschera_ opens February 2nd at 2pm at the Four Seasons Centre.

He will prattle on about the significance of the colour pewter as a symbol of virility, and ignore the fact that the singer onstage can't see the conductor while curled in the fetal position facing upstage. These details interrupt the Theatre Person's creative process.\n\nAnd best of all, the Theatre Person should not be criticized for his skills in time management; one must never go down in the history books as the critic who scoffed at the next artistic genius. Don't want to pull a Rite-of-Spring.\n\nBut it struck me recently, as a person who has been present in a wide range of rehearsal styles, that not all of these styles are equally, well, good.\n\nSure, there's a huge opportunity for magic to happen onstage as actors, singers and players improvise and throw themselves \"into the moment.\" But what's forgotten is that in any form of live theatre, the ability to appear organic and improvisatory onstage is a life-long skill to master.\n\nLeaving room for spur-of-the-moment inspiration in theatre is a must for any good director and artist. What the above Theatre Person often doesn't see is that this flexibility must come _after_ a director shares his detailed and complete idea for the arc of the piece. It's not about building up a piece from zero and leaving 10% room at the top for \"inspiration.\" It's about creating 100% of the piece, and then finding small points of wiggle room where it's still dramatically organic.\n\nThoughtful Canadian tenor Isaiah Bell sums up the process of becoming a performer who appears to be a \"natural\":\n\n> First you have to learn to sing, then you have to learn to forget you're singing but still be able to sing, and you have to learn stagecraft, and then go back and integrate the two, and then learn to forget about both, while still doing them, so that when you're in front of an audience all they're seeing is a person experiencing something, who also happens to be singing, and presenting their experience theatrically in such a way that people can understand it. It's incredibly complicated because you can't just tell someone who is still working on the first or second step to just go to the last step.\n\nHere's a fantastic example of improvisation with a massive foundation of musical skill: Victor Borge and Itzhak Perlman cranking out some sort of Hungarian rhapsody. Ridiculous.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvUbrbFdJ8g\n\nIt's fair to say that anyone putting on a piece of music theatre, opera, orchestra music, etc., has the goal of creating a performance that is easy and organic. But, says Bell, \"It's also important to realize that there's this huge base of work that has be done before we can see what it is that makes opera - or any theatre - so good.\"\n\nSo what's my point? It's that the product of a mediocre creative process is a mediocre performance. And dull shows can take the fun out of theatre for its biggest fans, let alone the general public. I think lazy artistry does a disservice to what's possible out in the music and theatre scenes; it's up to the artists to make sure they've stepped up in the detail department. It's up to, say, the trombonist in the band with the good phrasing idea to speak up and remind their colleagues that a higher bar always exists. It's up to the bass soloist in Beethoven's 9th to find something worth saying within his spitefully written part.\n\nAnd then the cool thing will happen: the audiences will start to notice a difference between something organic and something just simple. And they'll come back to the best for more.\n\nTo end on another Bell-ism, it's \"like Rembrandt training and honing his skills his whole life to paint something so finely that when you see it all you see is a real, whole person looking at you, seemingly captured in a single living moment from 400 years ago.\"\n\nDo you agree? Do you think we're being opera snobs? Let us know in the comments below!",

        "body": "On Wednesday, I braved the ridiculous snow for a much-needed Verdi fix at the Four Seasons Centre. The Canadian Opera Company's current production of [_A Masked Ball_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/UnBalloInMaschera.aspx) had piqued my interest, both for the exciting cast and for the production, of which I'd only seen a few curious photos.\nDirectors [Jossi Wieler](http://www.oper-stuttgart.de/jossi-wieler/wunderzaichen/jossi-wieler/) and [Sergio Morabito](http://www.oper-stuttgart.com/team/sergio-morabito/) capitalized on the timelessness of the libretto's dramatic themes: an unhappy marriage, a child caught between arguing parents, maintaining one's good public image, the desire for revenge. \"We wanted to explore how fragile our identity can be, how quickly apparently secure contexts and relationships – social, professional, family or personal – can break down.\"\n\nThe American setting of _A Masked Ball_ is one from the 1960s, making us immediately think of the Kennedy era (we even see Riccardo's wife, a silent, yet perfect inspiration of Jackie Kennedy Onassis). It also makes us think of America's first big example of the dark side of existence as a public figure.\n\nEndlessly interesting to look at, the sets and costumes by [Barbara Ehnes](http://www.staatsoper-berlin.de/en_EN/person/barbara-ehnes.30589) and [Anja Rabes](http://www.oper-stuttgart.com/anja-rabes-kostuembildner/) were colourfully sterile, enhanced with stark yet warm lighting by [Olaf Freese](http://www.staatsoper-berlin.de/en_EN/person/olaf-freese.30484). The chandeliers that hung from the ceiling were half disco-ball, half Swarovsky-crystal-chandelier-from-the-Met. They were tacky and fun, and for a few moments at the top of Act II, they stole my attention away from the body hanging from a noose, in plain view once you know it's there.\n\nThe singing was impressive from the entire cast. Tenor [Dimitri Pittas](http://dimitripittas.com/DimitriPittas/Home.html) (COC's _La bohème, Rigoletto_) appeared as Riccardo, starting off with a confident, relaxed sound. I thought he kept impressive stamina throughout the night, and he was thrilling at the top of his range. When he had more _sotto voce_ passages, including dramatic asides, his quiet singing didn't retain energy, and came across as comparitively under-sung. Dimitri embodied this production's idea of Riccardo; with confidence bordering on cockiness, he sets himself up perfectly for his inevitable fall. Very Alfredo.\n\nAs a foil to Riccardo, rising British baritone [Roland Wood](http://www.opera-rara.com/wood-roland-1.html) portrayed a powerful Renato in his COC debut. It struck me that this role is a beast, and takes until the final act to reveal itself as such. Roland started the night with menacing low notes and an incredible top, and filled out the role as it matured in the final act. His \"Eri tu\" was spectacular, earning applause even as he quickly rushed offstage.\n\nIn the role of Renato's adulterous wife, [Adrianne Pieczonka](http://www.adriannepieczonka.com/) was a rock star. This is another oddly paced role, and Adrianne (_Dialogues des Carmélites, Tosca) _sang it like the true definition of a working artist. She filled the hall with an enormous range of full and floating sounds, singing every note with intention. Her \"Morrò, ma prima in grazia\" brought down the house, and rightly so; it takes skill to make audiences sympathize with a cheating wife, and Adrianne has it. _ _I wasn't sure I'd be able to take seriously a soprano in her jammies, but Adrianne stole the stage using simply her instrument. You can _learn_ from this stuff.\n\n[Simone Osborne](http://www.cami.com/?webid=2171) (COC's _La bohème, Gianni Schicchi, Rigoletto_) sang the role of Oscar, a rare pants-role available to sopranos. In Wieler's and Morabito's production, Oscar is the stage name of a female performance artist in Riccardo's circles. Simone acted the show's ringleader at the top of the first act, creating a party every time she raised her arms, and later she rocked a knock-off of [Bjork's famous swan-dress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_dress_of_Bj%C3%B6rk) from the Oscars in 2001 (anachronism can get a pass at a costume party). She also gave us a night of impressive singing. Simone's was the first real Verdi singing of the night, cutting impressively in the middle range and having musical fun alongside her clear attention to detail.\n\nRussian mezzo-soprano [Elena Manistina](http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/singers/mezzo-soprano/elena-manistina) (_Il trovatore_) tore through her brief but mighty role of Ulrica, the (evil?) fortune-teller. She was appropriately uncomfortable to watch onstage, as she blindly struggled to her seat, and the anticipation to hear her voice couldn't have been higher. Elena has a powerhouse of a voice, with androgynous power in the bottom and a top register with which you shouldn't mess. I loved it.\n\nSmaller roles were at times hard to hear, but their characters were distinct. Canadian baritone [Gregory Dahl](http://www.gregorydahl.com/) sang Silvano, and basses [Evan Boyer](http://www.cami.com/?webid=2175) and [Giovanni Battista Parodi](http://www.arena.it/it-IT/PersonnelDetailit.html?idpersonnel=10011#.UvTzZ0JdXm4) were thug-like as Samuel and Tom.\n\nThe orchestra sounded generous and flexible under the baton of [Stephen Lord](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=28685) (_Lucia di Lammermoor_, _Norma_). Some singers were overpowered at the usual problematic times, but my orchestra level seats were close to one of the tricky acoustic spots in the Four Seasons Centre. It's most likely clearer as you go up the rings.\n\nI think Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito have the right idea when it comes to what themes to illuminate. I liked that they included details that put the ugly right next to the everyday (the body hanging from a noose amongst the chandeliers), but the execution often didn't work. The constant secret handshakes happening between Riccardo and Renato of course made their friendship clear, but when a handshake became a symbol of dramatic crisis (the fortune-teller predicted that Riccardo would be killed by the next man who shook his hand) the fist-bump-esque handshake they gave left me feeling a bit robbed of what is clearly a significant moment.\n\nI'm glad that Wieler and Morabito capitalized on the tragedy of the child caught in the middle of his parents' conflict; I think it's a win for this production that I felt such discomfort as I watched Renato introduce his young song to two of his thugs. Yet, like the noose and the handshakes, something felt gratuitous about the use of the eerily innocent child to show that danger is woven into this family's everyday lives. I'd say the directors were fortunate to have such a strong cast in this production; at the moments where the concept failed to help the story in an organic way, we were still carried by extraordinary music throughout.\n\n_A Masked Ball_ plays for six more shows at the Four Seasons Centre.

        "body": "I hear a lot of weird stuff at work. My job gives me the chance to sit in many a coaching or voice lesson and listen to how others impart wisdom and skills upon hardworking singers. Today, I heard the phrase, \"Mozart loved portamento!\" backed up with supposed evidence in Mozart's letters to his father.\n\nAnd these three harmless words irked me. Why? You probably think I'm going to talk about the validity of historical evidence, or bring up some musicological debate so inconsequential it hurts. But frankly, when it comes to an assertion like \"Mozart loved portamento!\" music history isn't even what's important.\n\nFor example: there's this spot in one Mozart aria that shows two notes, over one syllable, with a slur between them. In most opera singers' books, that equals a portamento. (It's tedious to define it, so if you're not sure what a portamento is, click _[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portamento)_.) There are plenty of debates about what Mozart's music should sound like, including the use of bendy pitches, i.e. a portamento. But one constant truth in the debate is that Mozart loved the human voice and loved to write for it.\n\nA statement like \"Mozart loved portamento!\" implies that there had been a question on whether or not the use of portamenti was stylistically appropriate. That's such a _boring_ question. The question should be, \"How do I make my voice sound like what the text means?\" If it means singing with more tension between each pitch, or bending pitch to get the affect of joy, loss, or lust, why not? Why would you take that tool off the table?\n\nMozart has written music that remains relevant over 200 years after his death; it was not the singers who premiered _Le nozze di Figaro_ or _Die Zauberflöte _that placed Mozart's operas among the most essential and influential in history. It was the music itself.\n\nAnd so I use the pros and cons of using a portamento in Mozart as an example: if there's nothing fallable, fragile, or spontaneous about a singer onstage, then there is nothing human, cathartic, or entertaining about the performance.\n\nI've referenced my director friend before; he maintains that Mozart was the greatest stage director to have lived. You can see what my friend means in simply the pages of the score. Any singer who has prepared an accompanied recitative by Mozart gets what I'm saying. Donna Anna, anyone?\n\n<figure adat-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-2RRyr9ZGQU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nThat's the difference between a dead composer and a working artist - one can still make decisions. But the decision should always be in the interest of serving the text. If it means siding with the Historically Informed Performance side of things, cool; if not, accusations of a stylistic faux-pas are unproductive. Mozart has written music that needn't be framed by historical practice, but by the ability to marry text to music.\n\nSo: \"Mozart loved portamento\" only means that Mozart loved expression. I don't know whether that sentence is more boring or redundant.",

        "body": "Last night, I watched with a perma-grin as my friends and colleagues in the [Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/aboutthecoc/companymembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx) had their performance of [_Così fan tutte_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/CosiFanTutte/EnsembleStudioPerformance.aspx) at the Four Seasons Centre. I was fortunate to have worked with some of the cast in the early stages of learning their roles, and it was an amazing experience to hear the final product. Often the long hours spent on the same score throughout a rehearsal process can dull the brain; it's easy to forget the accomplishments and leaps forward everyone has made, and to take for granted the beauty of what's being created. Through my time working with them, my media-privilege glimpses in rehearsals, and my personal relationships with many of the singers, I had the perfect balance of a peek inside and a blank slate with which to attend the performance.\nAnd man, did they sing their hearts out. In Act I, [Aviva Fortunata](https://twitter.com/AvivaFortunata) and [Charlotte Burrage](https://twitter.com/burragec) introduced Fiordiligi and Dorabella as the perfectly relatable girls that they are; they made me laugh, and they sang superbly. As Fiordiligi, Aviva's was some of the most impressive singing of the night. Her \"Come scoglio\" earned tons of applause, and rightly so; she was fierce and hilarious, all channeled through her powerful instrument. Charlotte's Dorabella was hysterical and hilarious, throwing a perfect tantrum with her aria, \"Smanie implacabili.\"\n\n[Andrew Haji](http://www.andrewhaji.com/) presented a heartfelt Ferrando, one you could tell was a good guy to the bone; his \"Un aura amorosa\" was bravely tender and smartly paced. Oh, and it was beautiful. [Cameron McPhail](https://twitter.com/Cameron_McPhail)'s Guglielmo was wonderfully specific, portraying a confident Guglielmo who lived large. He acted with his voice, including that ever-elusive comic timing.\n\nIn Act II, the bar remained high as we met [Sasha Djihanian](https://twitter.com/SashaDjihanian) (Fiordiligi) and [Danielle MacMillan](https://twitter.com/MezzoSopranoDan) (Dorabella), with adorable chemistry and a beautifully rich blend between their voices. They showed impressive musical maturity as they vocally negotiated the dramatically dense second act. Danielle's singing adapted to each scene with great ease; I went crazy for the warm sound she gave in her duet with Guglielmo, and her light top range was perfect for Dorabella's chatty aria, \"È amore un ladroncello.\" Sasha Djihanian also had a broad  range of colour to show as Fiordiligi. She thoughtfully used every musical opportunity to develop Fiordiligi's story, most memorable was her spectacular \"Per pietà, ben mio, perdona.\"\n\n[Owen McCausland](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=24213), another tenor who's easy to like onstage, continued the role of Ferrando into its most intriguing moments of conflict. I thought the difference between Owen's and Andrew's voice (unintentional as it may have been) actually worked very well for Ferrando's dramatic arc. Andrew's lighter, sunnier sound is a great set-up for Owen's reedier, fuller tenor singing; Ferrando is a character with the potential to break the hearts of any audience, and both Andrew and Owen created an organic journey from naive optimism to weighty realizations and the hardships of hindsight. Owen sang with plenty of colour, plenty of risk, and loads of intention. He had some great virile sounds at the top, adding strength to the list of Ferrando's traits and making us root for him even more.\n\nAs Act II's Guglielmo, [Clarence Frazer](https://twitter.com/clarencefrazer) achieved another seamless and conscious continuation of Cameron's performance in Act I. He showed us the same confidence we had come to know, and when the plot thickened, Clarence used his voice to rise to the occasion. His duet with Dorabella was sexy and honest (seems like an odd combo, but it's true), and his \"Donne mie\" was crisp and athletic. He was always entertaining to watch onstage, with fantastic attention to detail in his dramatic choices. Both Cameron and Clarence showed us that Guglielmo feels rejection just as loudly as he does happiness.\n\nThe two constants throughout the night were [Claire de Sévigné](http://www.clairedesevigne.com/) as Despina, and [Gordon Bintner](http://www.ariamanagement.com/en/nos-artistes/gordon-bintner-w/) as Don Alfonso. These two were absolute professionals, and it was more than a little proud-mama thrill to watch such a polished performance from both of them. Gordon had Old English Gentleman down pat in his dapper suit and silver hair; he was vocally solid the entire night, making the most of tiny musical and textual details to make Don Alfonso the rhetorical figure that he is. In this production, director Atom Egoyan asks much from Don Alfonso as an actor, and Gordon's portrayal of the professorial cynic was timed to a science. His Debus-inspired conducting gestures, his tiny interactions with the \"students\" in the chorus, and his significant glances across stage had the effect of being improvised ([a tricky skill to learn](http://schmopera.com/classical-musics-cock-eyed-optimism/)).\n\nIn easily the crowd-favourite role of the night, Claire de Sévigné's performance of Despina was just perfect. She sounded beautiful and bell-like all night, except when she decided to sing with a lisp, or in straight-tone, or any other effect one may have asked of her. Her photo-op facial expressions and superb comedy made sure she stole the audience's attention every time she appeared onstage. Like Gordon, Claire has mastered the art of making it look natural. Pair that with her night of great singing, and you've got a pro.\n\nI know from my own experience that it's an amazing bonding experience to put up a show of this size with your friends. I was reminded last night of a feeling I often take for granted: how fortunate I am to know people that have these awesome skills. I'll never forget the first time I stood backstage at the Four Seasons Centre and watched a friend make her entrance, her face instantly illuminated by the stage lights. The gulf between the person you had coffee with that afternoon and the artist that walks onto that stage seems suddenly so large; I am inspired to work in opera because of how it feels when that friend come back offstage and bridges that gulf, one of many times. I wonder if the COC Ensemble Intern pianist [Michael Shannon](http://michaelshannon.ca/) felt some of the same.\n\nSo I say bravo to the whole cast. You had big shoes to fill, and instead you did something better: bring your own shoes. Congratulations!\n\n<div class=\"intro\">For a look back at the COC Ensemble's rehearsal process, check out our three-part video series starting [here](http://schmopera.com/in-rehearsal-the-coc-ensemble-studio-part-1/).</div>",

And it took me so long to find the thing that my determination wilted. It was somewhere in that chunk of 9:41 or something, and, sure that I had combed through every second of that stupid clip in vain, I was experiencing an acute sensation of oncoming dementia.\n\nBut I realized that the problem is quite simple: online music has no idea what to do with classical music. And all I'm talking about is how the album information is displayed.  For example: you want to listen to part of Mozart's Requiem. When you pull up the album, this is what you see:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430272397636/Screen-Shot-2014-02-10-at-1.40.41-PM.png)\n</figure>\n\nHelpful.\nOr, you search for a recording of Wagner's Ring Cycle. On iTunes, you get this:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430272436294/Wagner-Search-iTunes-720x500.png)\n</figure>\n\nThis search was for \"songs,\" with the search terms \"wagner ring nibelung.\" You get a list of tracks from at least three different albums, one of them not a recording of any of the four operas, and the tracks are out of order. None of this matters if you're talking about mainstream commercial music. If you're searching for Bob Dylan, for example, the order of the songs or what album they're on isn't important for an accurate search result.\n\nIt's only a problem because the form used by online music services doesn't work for classical music or opera. Case in point, in the details for a DVD of _Le nozze di Figaro_:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430272468736/Amazon-Figaro-Album-Details.png)\n</figure>\n\nWriters. _Writers_. I don't know why that's so offensive. It's sort of like calling Frank Lloyd Wright a sketch artist. I mean, he sketches, but, come on.\n\nAnother example: at [barnesandnoble.com](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/Music-CDs-New-Releases-Reviews-Box-Sets/379003222), I filtered my search for Music > Opera and Vocal > Opera. I got a list of anthology-type albums, and the first complete work isn't even an opera:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430272516998/Barnes-and-Noble-Opera-Filter.png)\n</figure>\n\nI also checked out streaming services, including [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/), [Songza](http://songza.com/), [Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/) and [Jango](http://www.jango.com/). I found another culprit: automated playlists. Check out Grooveshark's search results for \"la traviata:\"\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430272601263/Grooveshark-Traviata-Search.png)\n</figure>\n\nIt's a freaking mess.\n\nOver at Songza.com, I tried searching opera through their playlist system. Here's what I got:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430272635750/Songza-Playlist-Sample-2.png)\n</figure>\n\nAnd when I checked out the Italian Cooking: Opera playlist (good title), the first song I got was \"Voi che sapete.\" Now, I get that tagging and probably an algorithm or two determines what kind of stuff ends up on these playlists, and it was clear that the criteria were limited to the terms \"Italian\" and \"opera.\" Fair. But an aria about puberty is not good cooking music.\n\nIt's not even that the content is bad. On [Rdio](https://www.rdio.com/account/signin/) I heard an insanely good live recording that (I didn't recognize) of \"Che gelida manina...\", but the stupid player was stuck on the previous \"song's\" track info. I'll never find out who it was. Sigh. It continued into someone's woofy rendition of \"Se vuol ballare,\" which was apparently on an album that included the subsequent recitative in the same track. Secco recit: also not good cooking music.\n\nWhat to do? It boils down to having someone around the offices at iTunes, Songza, etc., to consult on opera and classical music. It doesn't fit the same form as commercial music, and it says a lot about the online music industry that they don't seem to know how off-base they are.\n\nWouldn't it be neat if the track listings for an opera album gave you an idea of where you were in the story? Like for _La traviata,_ instead of this:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430272688716/Screen-Shot-2014-02-10-at-2.51.30-PM.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nThis:\n\n1.  The scene where everybody drinks.\n2.  Alfredo professes his love.\n3.  Violetta's gotta be free.\n4.  Their fake honeymoon.\n5.  Dad's guilt-trip.\n6.  Family conflict.\n7.  Misguided emotions.\n8.  Health problems.\n9.  Reunion, too little too late.\n\nOf course I'm being a brat about it, but if we had even a semblance of checkpoints like these in the track listings of opera albums, scrolling through to find where you are would be no biggie. And the artists involved should be searchable: if you've got Mirella Freni singing Mimì, you should be able to find her individually in each track in which Mimì sings. You'd be able to find Cherubino's part in the busiest Mozart finale by filtering the artist's name. Having the full name of the conductor and the orchestra (and sometimes the chorus) as a precursor to each scene's list of singers is respectable, but renders any mobile device useless when you're looking for the duet in Act II.\nOf course, I don't yet have the means to make this revolution happen. So this post is officially a rant. For another angle on the topic, check out [Molly Sheridan](http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/author/MollySheridan/)'s article at [New Music Box](http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/send-chutes-and-ladders/).\n\nIn the meantime, enjoy the hours spent in your iTunes libraries, tediously re-labelling every track in _La bohème._",

        "body": "So, it's the week of Valentine's Day, and I was trying to think of an appropriate post. I started thinking of opera couples, and the things they have in common. It turns out that the thing in common is a break-up of some sorts. And the majority of the time it's because the stories are from long ago, before women could stand up for themselves. So, in a manner far from lovey-dovey, I started thinking about what would have happened to our favourite opera heroines if they had existed today.\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not entirely sure about the point of this little what-if game, but it's fun.\n\nLet's start with my favourite: Violetta. Today, she'd be a sex worker in a classy establishment, with enough status and experience to have a group support system around her for protection against haters and threats. She'd also have a hidden self-esteem issue, and most certainly she'd have (to use a term I hate) trust issues. Given that Violetta has the means to refuse Germont's ridiculous request, her decision would be swayed simply by her insecurities and self-doubt. This version of the scene would make Violetta's confrontation with Germont a fascinating point of debate among stage directors. How fun.\n\nAnd how about Butterfly? If she'd met Pinkerton today, at least technology would be on Butterfly's side. She'd at least be able to get information about where he was, and get a hold of him to ask for child-support payments. I'm not sure of the Japanese-American diplomatic stuff involving paternity, but at least Butterfly wouldn't have to just _wait_.\n\nSame goes for Don José's childhood sweetheart Michaëla. Today, if she hadn't heard from DJ in a while, she could give him a call and save a lot of travel. And at least Facebook messages show read receipts.\n\nBut what about fiesty little Susanna? Today, she'd have the law on her side. Unless her boss was a criminal and had her cornered if she refused, Susanna (or Figaro, at the very least) could report the Count for being insane. I suppose the details would depend on where Susanna lives, but relative safety against predatory bosses is a fair assumption in the EU. (I'll politely ignore the potential can of worms I've opened, because I hope you see my point.)\n\nThat _was_ a fun little game.\n\nTo be fair, playing this little game with characters like Pamina, Semele, or even Tosca doesn't make sense. It's a moot point; these characters are specific to their environments, and their character traits are built out of their worlds.\n\nAnd I shouldn't have been surprised that the heroines from history's most important operas have traits that are common to any century. Violetta's insecurities, Susanna's financial dependence, Michaëla's hopelessness; we all know people like these women. We even know men like Alfredo and Figaro, stuck between duty in the immediate and in the bigger picture. We know men like Pinkerton, who confuses a person with an experience, or Don José, who handles his demons poorly and disappoints people who care about him.\n\nSo in the process of playing a silly game of hypotheticals with my favourite operas, their relevance became blatantly obvious. Now _that's_ timeless art.",

        "body": "This week, Canadian baritone and guitarist [Doug MacNaughton](http://www.dougmacnaughton.com/) releases _Guitarias._ It's his debut recording on the guitar, fusing what's clearly been two important elements to Doug's life as a musician.\n\nI listened to this album, for the most part, ignorant of much of its music. I of course knew a few works by [John Rutter](http://www.johnrutter.com/), and few a more by Canadian composer [John Beckwith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Beckwith_(composer)), and I'd heard of Canadians [William Beauvais](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Beauvais) and [Leslie Uyeda](http://www.leslieuyeda.com/). I felt slightly less ignorant when I saw two out of the three featured composers had written commissions for Doug himself. And so it was a novel experience to listen to unknown music written for a duo that wasn't a singer and a piano.\n\nIn Beckwith's set _Beckett Songs_, Doug strikes a balance between familiar minstrel-ish guitar sounds and the immediacy of text that is always found in Beckwith's vocal writing. I liked the flow in and out of meandering phrases, the poems' dramatic beats punctuated with free, improvisatory declamations. I'm also a big fan of [Samuel Beckett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett), so I was intrigued early on.\n\nDoug has a beautiful way with his voice in this album. It's a very vulnerable sound, and accessible. He's a study in clear singing in English. I got every word, and the tricky text was only obscured in the most extreme registers. I started noticing it particularly in _Flower Arranger_, a song that requires real storytelling. And in what I think is my favourite set on the album, Doug's freedom with the language and its relationship to the music were clearest in William Beauvais' _The Truth of the Matter_.\n\nJohn Rutter's song cycle for baritone and guitar, _Shadows_, was also new for me. The cycle sets texts from the 16th- and 17th-centuries, and I fell immediately for the charm in these songs. Rutter wrote the text setting and guitar part in that minstrel-ish style, and with the simplicity and definite stylistic lines clearly drawn, Doug presents to us a beautiful homage to centuries ago. I found much attention to truly the _sound __effect_ he gave us between the quality of his voice and the affect of the wandering guitar. There were the usual themes of love and rejection, and overdoing one's pleasure. I always love when something as blunt as form can create an environment where each musical detail is meaningful; Doug's rendition of _Shadows_ is a perfect example.\n\nAs he states in the program notes, Doug had considered recording the guitar and voice tracks separately, but instead decided to favour a live acoustic and the intimacy that is intended in this music, written for a singer to accompany himself. \"Double-tracking would have required a studio setting, and the guitar and voice parts wouldn't have been able to spontaneously respond to each other. The music is much more alive when both parts have the freedom to perform expressively.\"\n\nAnd that was what I enjoyed the most on this album. As someone who makes a career partly out of learning to read someone else's mind, I understand what it means for a soloist to feel free, and for an accompanist to have room to inspire. Listening to Doug sing and strum at the same time, I heard the sound that all duos try emulate. It's true, the sacrifice of a studio recording was no sacrifice at all when it brought us a friendly acoustic and the spontaneity of one person's musical train of thought.\n\n_Guitarias_ is available for purchase at Doug's [website](http://dougmacnaughton.com/recordings.html), and his CD launch party is this Sunday, February 16th from 3-7:00pm at Tall Boys Craft Beer House, 838 Bloor Street West, Toronto.",

        "body": "I feel like deconstructing today. I was going for lighter fare on a Sunday, which usually means heading over to the land of the opera nerds on Tumblr.\n\nSo when Tumblr ended up being more irritating than inspiring, I jumped out of the frying pan and right into the fire with, you guessed it, opera memes. Now, I'm a Redditor and an upfront music nerd. In my first year of university, my roommates and I even created a list of joke pick-up lines for musicians to use on each other. (Beginning with the borrowed, \"I'm a fermata, hold me\" and escalating to NSFW very quickly.)\n\nBut there's something about _opera_ memes that make me mental. It's partly because many of them are written by what seem like undergraduate music students, and the both the vocabulary and the hyperbole just scream \"I'm a freshman who just learned EVERYTHING in my lesson today.\" I'll explain in more detail as we continue.\n\n###First up: the Double Nerd.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430188379987/boromirpassaggio.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nNo, of course one doesn't. Just like one doesn't just walk into Mordor, right? I feel like this was written by someone who didn't know what a _passaggio_ was until October of 2013\\. I say October of 2013 because that gives a first-year voice student enough time to have heard of the word _passaggio_, have one lesson in which they discover how hard it is, and go to one studio class where they see another student fail at _passaggio_-negotiation, and tsk-tsk them for trying to push their way through. \"Amateur,\" this meme-author thinks. This must be how church choir directors feel when they hire a student from the local university to be in their tenor section (they always need tenors, _amiright_?) and all she does is pipe up about the group's collective vowel placement or some garbage like that.\n\n###Next up: the _Faching_ Snob, once removed.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430188534545/zwischenfach.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nThis one just.... I mean, it IS interesting! From my own experience, it really is neat if someone fits in the cracks of our traditional definitions of voice types. Yes, young voice students _love_ them some voice classification, and it's usually premature and adorably ignorant. I once met a 19-year old who told me she was a spinto-lyric soprano _con agilità_. She was so weird. So yeah, young singers like to set themselves apart with these labels, but the crazy thing is this: _sometimes they're right_. Jeez.\n\n###Related is the meme by the masochistic voice student:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430188433293/taminoartsongs.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nAgain: it's true that most young singers are best suited for art song repertoire and not operatic arias. But some arias are lighter/easier/more age-appropriate than some art songs. Can I get an _Erlkönig_ in here? Sometimes, it's alright to sing an aria. No one will die.\nIf you've studied an instrument at your university, you're familiar with the stereotype that singers, in general, are stupid. And here, we've got a meme written by a singer who doesn't understand why:\n\n\n\nOk. I just want to clear up the obvious right away: \n\n###Instrumentalists go to summer programs too, you know.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430188614039/summerbreakmorpheus.jpg)\n</figure>\n\n*cough[Orford](http://www.arts-orford.org/en/)coughcough* I suppose this meme was created because some flautist (it _would_ be a flautist) at some school made some snide comment to a singer that suggested that said singer had not been working hard at their craft all summer long. But, Singer, let's face it; the flautist isn't ignorant that summer programs exist for your people, the flautist is assuming you'd be as slack about your practicing habits as you'd been all year at school. I know, I know, I face criticism for backing the dumb-singer stereotype. But if it walks like a duck.... No, seriously, I'm the first to admit that opera singers not only have to be just like athletes, but also be able to quickly retain massive amounts of information and multitask like a fiend. And it takes brains, and tons of hard work. But it is my theory that students who study singing at a post-secondary institution can stay in the game as long as instrumentalists can, while having less general musical knowledge. I'm just saying, if you've never had to learn harmonic analysis in order to memorize a Chopin nocturne, you could potentially still sing like a god. There is inevitably a point of no return, where the less-educated singer simply does not have the practical tools (i.e. sight-reading ability, ease with languages, good sense of rhythm) to make it in his industry.\n\nOkay, I'm shaking that last one off. Here's one last bit of silliness that I think is legitimately funny:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430188644785/coloraturatoohigh.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nI remember the first time I worked in a lesson with Tracy Dahl; she sang like a high D in full voice, and I remember the word, \"extraterrestrial\" coming to mind. I like this meme because I read it in the guy's voice, all southern and declamatory. \"High\" would be IPAed as \"hæ.\"\n\nFor your fix of opera nerdery, check out the [Opera Singer Meme](https://www.facebook.com/OperaSingerMemes) Facebook page, or [@OperaMemes](https://twitter.com/OperaMemes) if Twitter is more your thing. [Anne Midgette](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-classical-beat/2010/03/opera_the_meme.html)'s piece for the Washington Post offers a more mature look at the phenomenon of opera memes, although I feel she's confused a meme with a flashmob.\n\nSince I'm sure all these opera-nerd memes will stick around for at least another year, I'm considering making this a recurring post.

That lady is just great. I'm not sure if everyone will remember this, but I spotted that letter to the editor that Joyce wrote [for a publication by online magazine _Opera21_](http://opera21.tumblr.com/post/43085440555/february-2013-issue). The letter was addressed to young fans of opera, urging them to resist becoming cynics. It was posted on _Opera 21_ as well as [Joyce DiDonato's blog](http://www.joycedidonato.com/2013/02/15/a-letter-to-the-up-coming-opera-lovers/) about a year ago, and I'm sharing it here because it's a perfect articulation of [our goal](http://schmopera.com/about/) here at Schmopera. She makes the case for young critics to remain above snobbery, and to that I give a hearty thumbs-up. Here's the [full letter](http://www.joycedidonato.com/2013/02/15/a-letter-to-the-up-coming-opera-lovers/) by the fabulous Joyce DiDonato:\n\n> #### Dear Opera21,\n> \n> #### Congratulations on the launch of this exciting on-line magazine where each of you can delve deeper and deeper into your passions for opera and music!  It’s wonderful for me to have the confirmation of _my_ passion about opera through _your_ eyes, because each of you are ignited by the same emotional journeys, breathtaking musical moments and awe-inspiring productions that I am, and you are eagerly seeking a way to learn more.  Trust me, as long as you’re game, the journey of discovery never ends! _Enjoy it!_\n> \n> #### I predict your operatic journey may sometimes be a love/hate relationship – for where there are big passions, there can be enormous disappointments.  Whether you are an aspiring singer who faces a deluge of rejections (oh, they’ll be there – just keep breathing!), or a fan who suffers through a cast that isn’t to your liking (or, God forbid, isn’t the same singer you first saw when you fell in love with a particular opera back in 2009…!), the disappointments will most definitely be there.\n> \n> #### But so will the euphoric moments, and those blessed moments of tears and laughter or overwhelming profundity – or you’ll receive that first contract, or be accepted into the ensemble and begin relationships with friends who will be with you for life.  The highs and the lows will both feed you in completely different ways and ultimately bring more depth and joy into your life.\n> \n> #### But may I offer one word of caution, or request one small favor?  Please don’t become a snob.  Please just resist that urge should it rear its ugly head. It’s not cool, definitely not attractive, and terribly, _terribly_ boring. No matter how much you know, or how much you see and hear, and no matter how strong your opinions are, please don’t flirt with that imperial “level of knowing” where you stop listening, stop feeling, and stop learning.  By all means, be critical if you like, but please consider offering your opinions with grace and elegance. In other words, “Stay classy.”  Trust me, it will enhance your operatic experience by miles.\n> \n> #### Throughout those inevitable highs and lows, please fight to keep the faith, and please do your part to keep the dialogue open and moving forward, so that you (yes,** YOU**) can be a part of the solution and not a part of the problem.  I want YOU to help figure out where opera goes in YOUR Century.  Get creative, spread the word, think outside the box, be open enough so that the newcomers who will come and look to you for guidance will feel welcome, and please keep listening with those curious, eager ears so that the next generations of singers won’t feel that they have to compete with a “DiDonato” or a “Florez”.  (Not that there is anything wrong with either of those two!)\n> \n> #### Finally, at last its my turn to stand up and applaud each of YOU, and yell BRAVI for your efforts and for your enthusiasm!  You are my argument against “Opera is a dying art form”, so get loud, get strong, and yes, stay classy!\n> \n> #### CHEERS!\n> \n> #### Joyce\n\nLove it. [@Gerald Finley](https://twitter.com/GeraldFinley) started following [@Schmopera](https://twitter.com/Schmopera) today. Maybe he'll write us a letter soon.",

        "body": "Each year the COC Ensemble and the Atelier lyrique de L'Opéra de Montréal send several of their respective artists on a week-long exchange. The artists travel to Toronto or to Montréal to work with teachers, coaches and dramaturges at the opposite company, and give local concerts highlighting the visiting singers and pianists. So like previous years, my curiosity was piqued as I arrived at the concert.\n\nThe four visiting singers from OdeM each sang two arias and a duet or trio with a member of the COC Ensemble. (Excluding, unfortunately, Florie's duet with Gordon Bintner, who did not sing due to illness.) Soprano [Florie Valiquette](http://www.operademontreal.com/fr/mediatheque#!/florie-valiquette-canada) began with a clear, appealing \"S'altro che lagrime,\" from _La clemenza di Tito_. Her singing was very pretty, although it sounded a bit safe. When she returned to sing \"En proie à la tristesse\" from Rossini's _Le comte d'Ory_, I heard what she could really do. Her coloratura was agile and still beautiful, moving from florid passages into a fierce run to the end, wisely pacing that classic Rossini aria-recipe. I heard Florie in last year's Ensemble/Atelier concert in the RBA, and she really impressed me with the difference in her sound today. She had clear ring throughout her range, indicating a mature approach to singing coloratura.\n\nMezzo-soprano [Emma Char](http://www.emmachar.com/) was boyish and spontaneous with her \"Que fais-tu, blanche tourterelle.\" She showed off an easy top and a convincing character. I was so sold on her Stefano that I wasn't sure how she'd pull off her second aria, Barber's \"Must the winter come so soon.\" But I _really_ liked her in this.  I was surprised by how she filled the aria's roomy legato and maintained a captivating stillness; I was left wondering if she had more of that lush singing to offer in moments of her first aria.\n\nWe then heard [Rachèle Tremblay](http://www.operademontreal.com/en/multimedia#!/rachele-tremblay-canada), a native of Chambord, QC. Her first aria was the ever-famous \"When I am laid in Earth,\" from _Dido and Aeneas_. I have to admit, seeing it in the program made me prematurely (and unfairly) bored. But I thought Rachèle did her best singing in this aria, and she gave a rich warmth in her low register. She held on to her phrases to the very end, keeping us captive throughout this aria that has a history of maintaining a glacial pace. She returned later to present Strauss' \"Sein wir wieder gut,\" my favourite holler-fest from the mezzo repertoire. This was a new piece for Rachèle, and I thought she demonstrated that Strauss will be on her professional plate in the future. She a powerful mezzo sound that will take her far, and although her top register had a tendency to go a bit wild, Rachèle has an instrument that will enjoy this kind of repertoire sooner rather than later.\nIn the last of the away-team's appearances, baritone [Cairan Ryan](http://www.cairanryan.com/) broke the tension with an impressive \"Largo al factotum.\" Whenever a pianist breaks into those first few bars of Rossini, and there's no singer yet in sight, I can safely prepare myself for an unorthodox entrance. And lo, from the heights of the fourth ring, Cairan solfegged his way down the Amphitheatre's glass stairs and landed in the curve of the piano, just in time for his first line. This aria always feels like a party piece, but it's a technical beast for the singer, and Cairan had it within his control. He sang with a bright, honest sound that gave him lots of opportunity for humour; his ease of the famous tongue-twisting text was commendable, and he left himself enough juice for all the high notes too.\n\nCairan returned later in the concert to sing the famously beautiful \"Mein Sehen, mein Wähnen\" from Korngold's _Die tote Stadt. _For me, this aria's beauty is a no-brainer. And given a baritone has the range and control required, all that's alluring about the aria is in the score. Cairan set his performance apart with his use of the German text. I heard new phrasing, and I certainly heard Cairan's love of the words he sang. I have a feeling he'll find a home in much of the contemporary English opera coming out of North America.\n\nBookending the program were duets and trios which included members of the COC Ensemble Studio. Rachèle Tremblay and [Aviva Fortunata](https://twitter.com/AvivaFortunata) opened with \"Come ti piace, imponi\" from _La clemenza di Tito_. Both singers were at home in their roles, and it was a good preview of what we may hear from them in the near future.\n\nEnsemble members Aviva Fortunata and [Claire de Sévigné](http://www.clairedesevigne.com/) joined mezzo Emma Char in a performance of the jaw-droppingly beautiful trio from _Der Rosenkavalier,_ \"Hab mir's gelobt.\" This is another piece that basically writes itself, and this performance was beautiful. Claire is a perfect fit for Strauss' soprano roles, and I'm excited to hear her do more in the future. Aviva suited the role of the Marschallin, and pretty soon the hesitancy that may have been there today will be gone. Emma got slightly lost in the balance, but that's pretty standard for this trio. Their blend was lovely, and it was a treat to hear this gem in the middle of the day.\n\nCairan Ryan was joined by Ensemble member [Andrew Haji](http://www.andrewhaji.com/) for a performance of \"Au fond du temple saint,\" Bizet's famous duet from _Les pêcheurs de perles_. This was a highlight for me; I realized I hadn't heard Andrew sing in French, and I _loved_ his singing in this duet. Both singers have a clear sound, and the blend was lovely.\n\nFamiliarly, the singers all returned to the stage for a _tutti_ rendition of the \"Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour\" from Offenbach's _Les contes d'Hoffmann_. I know from personal experience that this is a common way to end these exchange concerts; I was torn between some nostalgia and wondering if the group could have finished with something a little flashier.\n\nPianist [Michael Shannon](http://michaelshannon.ca/) of the COC Ensemble played impressively throughout the concert. It's particularly hard for a pianist to play a program of excerpts. It means lots of hats to put on, and lots of different ways to play, and Michael showed he had no fear of binders full of arias. Atelier pianist [Jennifer Szeto](http://www.operademontreal.com/en/multimedia#!/jennifer-szeto-canada) was seated beside Michael playing the role of page-turning; I couldn't help wondering why she wasn't involved in the concert. Then again, she'll be [joining the COC Ensemble](http://www.coc.ca/aboutthecoc/mediaroom/MediaReleases.aspx?EntryID=28627) next season, so she'll have plenty of time to enjoy the Amphitheatre.\n\nIf there's anything to notice when comparing the artists in the COC Ensemble to those in the Atelier, it's the size of voice. I had a feeling that the singers from Montréal had more voice in them, and seemed to be singing on the safe side. When they were joined by Ensemble artists, this difference was particularly noticeable. Without knowing the artists better, I don't have any conclusions to make about this. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the concert, and it was a nice peek at what's happening with young opera singers elsewhere in the country.\n\nWere you at the concert. What did you think?

I'm talking about the [COC's production of Handel's _Hercules_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/Hercules.aspx), directed by the infamous [Peter Sellars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellars). I just can't imagine what won't be to love. American baritone [Eric Owens](http://imgartists.com/artist/eric_owens) stars as Hercules, and British mezzo-soprano [Alice Coote](http://imgartists.com/artist/alice_coote) will sing the role of his wife, Dejanira. Man, oh man, will I be there with bells on.\n\nOn top of Owens and Coote, we'll hear British soprano [Lucy Crowe](http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/singers/soprano/lucy-crowe) in her COC debut as Iole, Hercules' prisoner of war. Her performance at Lyric Opera of Chicago earned great reviews, and the assertion that she is “a major discovery” (_Chicago Tribune_).\n\nAmerican tenor [Richard Croft](http://imgartists.com/artist/richard_croft) (from the COC's _Così fan tutte_ in 1992) will appear as Hercules' son, Hyllus. Chicago loved him too, declaring that he is \"firmly in his vocal element\" in this role (_Chicago Tribune_).\n\nAnd one mustn't forget about the one and only [David Daniels](http://www.danielssings.com/), the American countertenor who's bound to show us all how to sing Handel. “To say that he is the most acclaimed countertenor of the day, perhaps the best ever, is to understate his achievement. He is simply a great singer” (_New York Times_).\n\nA co-production with [Lyric Opera of Chicago](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/03/opera-review-peter-sellars-stages-handels-hercules-in-chicago.html), Sellars' direction will present \"a stinging, profoundly moving examination of the domestic aftermath of modern war” (_Opera News_). Sellars evokes the world of Ancient Greece while telling a story that maintains relevance  with the lives of soldiers and soldiers' families today.\n\nAnd with Harry Bickett on the podium (from the COC's _Orfeo ed Euridice in 2011, Idomeneo in 2009, and Rodelinda in 2005_), the music will no doubt be stellar. In Chicago, he “conducted a performance true to the spirit of Handel’s time yet truer still to Sellars’ stress points” (_Los Angeles Times_).\n\nI just can't wait. Stuff like this makes the cold slightly more bearable, no?\n\n_Hercules_ runs at the Four Seasons Centre from April 5-30, 2014: call 416-363-8231 for tickets. For info on special ticket prices, including rush seating, and Opera Under 30 tickets, visit [www.coc.ca](http://www.coc.ca/).\n\n*One more thing! Don't miss the COC's Opera Exchange symposium _Coming Home: Handel's Hercules_ on April 4, 2014, 9:30am to 4pm. Director Peter Sellars will be a big part of it, and you really don't want to miss a chance to hear him speak. Tickets are limited, so click [here](http://coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/Adults/TheOperaExchange.aspx) for more details.",

        "body": "## 1. How to take criticism like a pro.\n\nEvery single aspect of a singer's job includes hearing criticism. They get it from teachers, conductors, directors, coaches, and of course, critics. You know, after sitting at the piano through many, _many_ voice lessons, I've never felt an urge to attempt to do what singers do. It's too difficult; and too many people have an opinion on how to do the difficult thing, and I honestly don't know how professional singers do it.\n\nActually, that's not true. I know exactly how they do it: they become an expert in separating their professional and personal selves. I watch the best singers take criticism with ease, and I imagine an inner monologue that sounds something like this: \"Oh, I'm flat? _When will this curse of intonation problems leave me?_ ? But yes, I can totally sing it in tune.\" It's a lesson in deciding whether or not to take criticism personally, and knowing that the choice is there.\n\n## 2. How to take charge of your health.\n\nEverything there is to know about staying healthy, I learned from hanging out with opera singers.\n\n*   Get lots of sleep.\n*   Drink tons of water.\n*   Exercise.\n*   Eat food that won't make acid/phlegm/halitosis happen.\n*   Learn to _breathe_.\n\nIt's so simple it hurts. And of course, opera singers are not the only people who know how to maintain their health. But like professional athletes or dancers, singers are held so accountable for these choices that they just can't _afford_ to be unhealthy.\n\nIt's also more than a difference between being healthy and being sick. Obviously a head cold is inconvenient for any singer. But also inconvenient are a dry mouth, blood sugar spikes, and the hiccups. These things can cost singers their work, and the smart ones quickly compile a mental list of foods/behaviours that are good and bad ideas.\n\nAnd if a singer _does_ get sick, they don't waste time moping. They get on that cold-med train or that vitamin regime or that acupuncture deal, or whatever, and they get back to their 100%, dammit. [Neti Pot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_irrigation), anyone?\n\n## 3\\. How to choose happiness.\n\nSingers travel _all the time_. It means they get to see the world and see new things, and the industry makes it easy to meet fascinating people with fascinating lives. Singers who have this kind of career, away from home 10 months of the year, often make big sacrifices in their personal lives. They may have a family and have to leave them at home when they travel for work. Or perhaps they decide not to have a family in order to more easily pursue a career. In a way that many (perhaps most?) of us aren't forced to, singers are inevitably faced with the large question of what to do with one's life. The career is so time- and energy-consuming that it's often a wise decision to concentrate on one or the other, at least for a period of time.\n\nSingers are faced with a question that is ultimately reduced to the question we all ask of ourselves: What will make me happy? It's of course a simple and profound question that I won't unpack here. But my point is that most people aren't presented with a choice between two broad options that could offer happiness. But singers, given they have the will and drive to sing professionally, _are_ granted that choice. They make calculated, often self-sacrificing decisions as they balance a type of life that I think many of us may take for granted.\n\nDo you think there's more to learn from an opera singer? You're probably right: let us know in the comments below!",

        "body": "I want people to like me.  I got into singing because I want people to like me.\n\nYup.\n\nOf course, I didn’t think of it like that at the time; wanting people to like you is not necessarily an attractive quality.  Later, when I really thought about what it means to be a performer, I decided that I didn’t actually want it to be about me.  I’m a conduit; the creators of the piece speak to the audience through me, and as the message passes through me my own watermark is imprinted on it, etc.  Which is all well and good, but I still want people to like me.\n\nIf things are going well, these two objectives can cohabit fairly amicably.  The trouble comes when I feel like I’m not doing well at my job – which is to sing awesome high notes and to sing in tune and to sing fast notes really fast, and to be “musical,” and to pretend to be someone who is not me, who is doing something that is not what I’m doing (“acting”).  At these times all I can think is, wow, you are doing a really bad job.  All that space in my head that should be filled up with – where does Ernesto/Tamino/”The First Jew” (“me”) want to go next, how can I participate more actively in this music that I’m absent-mindedly reciting, for God’s sake what am I _saying_ – is taken up entirely with, you’re a bad singer.  Worse: you’re a bad person.  All these people know you’re a fraud.  They’re bored, uncomfortable and/or actively angry at you for being a waste of their time and money.  You have failed them and yourself.\n\nSeriously.  Now, imagine how inspiring and transporting the performance is going to be when the tenor is having _that_ conversation in his brain.\n\nLet’s be clear.  Classical singing is hard.  I’m a hard worker, and totally dedicated, but sometimes things just don’t work out.  It takes a long time to get good at it, and it’s the finickiest of disciplines, and even the greats have crashed and burned at some point or other.  But seriously.  This goes on in my head _all the time_.\n\nSo the whole time that this has been happening (a period of time that coincides exactly with the amount of time I’ve been performing), I’ve enabled the onslaught of self-loathing that occurs when the reality of my performance isn’t up to standard with _this_ logic (“logic”):\n\na) _When I’m good_, this won’t happen any more.\n\nb) It’s important for me to know when I’m doing badly, so that I can fix it later.\n\nc) It’s my responsibility to the audience/my mentor/my friends/the engager to do well. When I do poorly, I have failed them and must take responsibility for that failure.\n\nd) It’s important that I know I’ve done badly, _so that no one can surprise me with this information later_.  If I’m aware before anyone else is, at least I retain some measure of control and dignity in the situation.\n\nIt’s not that I actually think this a healthy thought pattern; I’m acutely aware of how debilitating it can be, and I‘ve developed some strategies to reduce its impact by keeping other focuses.  But it hasn’t been until recently that I’ve realized how much the responsibility for it actually rests on my **ego**.\n\nThat may sound stupid, because a bruised ego is obviously the thing that’s smarting after a singing snafu.  But it’s less obvious, to me at least, that this act of self-deprecation is an actual _function_ of my ego.  I always thought that the bad feeling was my poor tender ego being victimized by external standards.  But the truth seems to be that it is my ego itself that is doing the attacking.\n\nMy brain registers the information: this is not going very well.  Leaving aside whether or not my brain _should_ be analyzing instead of doing (another topic for another day), and whether or not I have set an impossible standard (yet another topic – many _fascinating_ pages of navel-gazing to come), this information, at times, comes to be registered.  Now, a logical mind that was not entirely dominated by a megalomaniacal ego would probably go: - That sucks.  Let’s try to finish what we’re doing in the best way we can, and figure out later what went wrong. -  A logical mind, that is, recognizes that when the plane’s engines are failing, even _more_ energy and mental faculties need to be devoted to landing the plane safely, and approximately 0% of available resources should be spent yelling in the pilot’s ear that this is his fault and he will never fly again.\n\nBut when my **crazy** ego catches wind of this information, all hell breaks loose (since less-than-perfect singing obviously equals universal rejection).  So immediate is its need to feel constant approval that it begins to override all other functions.  My ego,  like a hungry child, has no concept of the bigger picture or of anything outside the immediate: feed me; like me. When it reacts so violently to a performance gone awry, it’s as if it is trying to punish the rest of me, the “parent”, for not doing well enough. You got me into this situation; I am being hurt by your failure.  When something goes wrong, we always look for someone to blame: it’s in our nature.  With me, it’s me.\n\nAnd, of course, these ego tantrums aren’t limited to the actual performance, but continue long afterwards, when the spoiled child/fussy ego has to be pampered and bribed into not making such a stink.\n\nNone of this is particularly shocking information, and when it’s all laid out I wonder why I didn’t make these connections sooner.  But after distilling countless hours’ worth of abject misery into this tidy observation, I have come up with a “well, when you put it like that…” moment.\n\nI really want to be liked.  I want to be liked so bad that it routinely derails me.  The more important something is to my success as a singer, the easier it is for my ego to take over.  My full self is more complicated than that, though.  Sure, everybody wants to be liked.  It’s a basic instinct.  But the part of me that has bigger ideas – the part that wants to use my hard work and my gifts to spread beauty, to say through music what can’t be said in words, to connect people to each other by sharing different understandings of the human experience – needs to be the parent.  It’s not really about me.  If I’m in this career to get approval and feel validated, I’m going to have a life full of disappointment, and any joy I bring to people is going to be a **by-product** of my own quest to feed my ever-expanding, ever-demanding ego.\n\nSince putting this all together, I’ve been afforded, ahem, a *number* of opportunities to test out this outlook, on Real Life Performance Difficulties.  Cutting the ego tantrum short doesn’t always work, but when it does the difference is tangible.  Not only can I actually _feel_ that my energy is freed up to address the problem at hand – the energy that has historically, in these situations, been caught in a whirlpool of judgement – but when I get offstage I’m often able to dodge that crushing wave of post-performance self-loathing.  I know that I didn’t waste resources beating myself up for doing a bad job when I should have been focusing on doing that job.  I did the best I could.  It’s liberating – so liberating that I’ve actually caught myself feeling bad for not feeling bad.  I’m so used to raking myself over the coals for every bungled bar that I felt like I was letting myself off the hook.  **_How crazy is that_**?",

        "body": "\n\n###1. Can you tell us what you love most about your career?\n\nWhat I love most about my career can be summed up in two words: “being relevant”.  To be somewhat of a force in the most demanding artistic endeavor known to humankind is fulfilling and humbling at the same time.  James Levine, with whom I made my Metropolitan Opera debut with my signature role of _Mime,_ once said that the Met stage is a big place that requires big people, big voices, and big personalities.  To become known and respected for bringing my roles ‘to life’, whether big or small, is quite a compliment in an industry where the emphasis is often placed on the newest rising young star.  I am now a veteran of the industry, and am quite impressed when an opera company will cast their operas with as deep a bench as someone like myself, who now brings not only his own special brand of acumen to the stage, but decades of experience too.  To now be recognized as “luxury casting” in some circles is quite a thrill, but I still bring the same enthusiasm to each performance now as I did over 20 years ago in an effort to: _stay relevant_!!\n\n###2. What's it like to be known for singing supportive roles?</span>\n\nThis is _my_ saying:  “There are no small roles in opera…only small voices.”  While this is meant to be humorous, and has indeed garnered many laughs over the years, it remains an absolute truism.  A chain is only as strong as its weakest link; and in the ever-competitive pastiche that is opera today, it is now even more important to bring everything you have to every role.  It is employing this exact philosophy that has kept me active for over two decades.  I have, and continue to do, opera’s ‘smaller’ roles, but always make an impact.  I also sing opera’s larger(est) roles, such as the aforementioned Mime (smaller role in _Rheingold_, HUGE role in _Siegfried_), Prunier (_Rondine_), Shuisky (_Godunov_), Pedrillo (_Abduction_).  They are not title roles, but if they are not done well, it can be a long night in the opera house while waiting for the star to sing again!  If they are done excellently, one will leave a bigger impression behind than the size of the role itself.  I am opera’s ‘utility baseball player’…I play every position really well…but no one expects me to crush the baseball each time while at bat.  When I do, which is most of the time (if I can say so humbly), it leaves a real impression.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430174563313/12-13-02-b-mc-d-3790.jpg)\n<figcaption>Jan Pohl and David Cangelosi in the COC's production of Die Fledermaus, 2012. Photo by Michael Cooper</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### 3. Are there any unique challenges in performing character or _comprimario_ roles?\n\nWhen doing the plumb cameos, character, and comprimario roles; the big challenge is the amalgamation and compression of text, music, and staging all at once.  Everything has to come together with precision because your stage time is often limited.  There is no time to “make up for it later”.  It’s all or nothing, all at one time.  Every word is important, every musical moment is important.  If you do it well, you will be respected and remembered.\n\n### 4. How do your passions for travel and music coincide?\n\nThe passion for travel and music is so simple that one can easily overlook it… Each opera (and song for that matter) is set in a different locale worldwide, and at a different time period in history.  I sang the dual roles of Noctambulist/Pape de Fous in _Louise_ at the Spoleto Festival a few years ago_,_ and as the ‘Embodiment of Paris’, I brought so much more to these roles (even if only internally/psychologically) simply because I have spent so much time in Paris itself.  Goro (_Butterfly_), or Pang (_Turandot_) are sung and acted completely differently once one has actually spent time in Japan and China.  Instead of creating _caricatures_, one can create believable CHARACTERS.\n### 5\\. How do you maintain a routine while on the road?\n\nWhen ‘on the road’, as I have been for decades (including 10 years as a nightclub entertainer before I began an opera career), the road _becomes_ your life. The advent of internet banking has truly simplified our lives as a matter of pragmatism. On a less practical--more personal level, however, one must like their own company…meaning you had better be comfortable with yourself, because you are going to be spending a lot of time alone and in temporary housing.  It can be lonely, frustrating, and depressing.  At the same time, it is exhilarating, exciting, and uplifting.  I ALWAYS take a tourist oriented ‘guided bus tour’ of every city I am in the first time.  I just love them!!  I walk lots of places, and stop into a few watering holes/restaurants regularly to speak with locals.  I like to get a flavor of each locale, and ‘a read’ on the people.  You’d be surprised to find how similar _and_ different each new city truly is.  It’s only after a bit of digging that one begins to discover the nuances that make each locality unique.\n### 6\\. Can you tell us about your longest flight?\n\nThe longest flight is either New York to Auckland, New Zealand; or Melbourne, Australia.  The craziest thing that is well documented in my worldwide travel, has been flying to Kuwait or Dubai for lunch, and then flying right back home on the night flight! This schedule always results in an extra security sweep for me at international airports…!\n### 7\\. How do you find the work environment and the audiences in Toronto?\n\nI, in fact, [did a full blog](http://www.davidcangelosi.com/expectations-and-turning-points-a-coc-timeline/) (or two) at [davidcangelosi.com](http://www.davidcangelosi.com/) about my experience in Toronto. I thought it was the most interesting and forward edging company with whom I have ever been invited to sing.  The energy from the Administration is young and decidedly non-corporate; the workplace environment is friendly, eye pleasing, and comfortable; the theater is new and acoustically satisfying; the talent base is first rate on an international level; the support teams (musical staff, stage management, stage crew) are outstanding and well prepared; and the other artistic departments (wigs/makeup/wardrobe etc.) are as creative and professional as I have experienced at such august organizations as Lyric Opera of Chicago, Paris Opera, San Francisco Opera, or the Metropolitan Opera.  What’s not to like???\n### 8\\. Do you have any professional highlights?\n\n_Pagliacci_ starring Domingo and televised (Washington Opera), _Rheingold_ at the Met (debut), two different outstanding _Ring_ Cycles (Chicago, San Francisco), a feature film version of _Tosca_ (Venice Film Festival), and a _Highlights from the Ring_ recording project with Placido Domingo/Covent Garden Orchestra in London, and participating in the venerable Otto Schenk and current Lepage _Ring_ at the Met, are among the most treasured of highlights.  But to also say you have sung in Carnegie Hall, and the Hollywood Bowl are ancillary delights to recall as well.  Additionally, to say that you have worked _personally_ with Domingo, Levine, Zeffirelli, Boulez, Bartoletti, Conlon, Slatkin, Runnicles, Ozawa, Menotti, Pappano, Zambello, Robert Wilson, Robert Altman, Anthony Minghella, and a plethora of other great directors, singers, and conductors, is not something that everyone can boast.  I am among the last of a generation to have had real, meaningful contact with the previous (and still current) generation of true classicists.\n### 9\\. Why do you think you've succeeded in striking a balance between your personal and professional lives?\n\nThere really is no such thing as “striking a balance” on this subject in my opinion.  This is actually a constant _management_ issue.  I have been lucky to be surrounded with supportive people in my life, which includes of course my recent wife.  When you are away on ‘professional assignment’, it’s hard to say that your ‘personal life’ is in balance; and for the most part Vice-Versa.  As a practical matter, it is always important to make sure that some way, some-_how_, we make a point of seeing one another after not more than 3 weeks.  Should you have a loved one, spouse, or partner; this seems to be the outside range one can be away from the other before beginning to feel disconnected.\n### 10\\. Do you have any roles on your \"Bucket List\"?\n\nOnly one role had eluded me all of these years…I would love to do the Wicked Witch (_Hansel & Gretel_).  To this end, I must say that I have really done all of the roles that I have wished to do at this point, and a few that I _never_ thought that I would have done (Tobias Ragg in _Sweeney Todd_, and Shuisky in _Boris Godunov_, to name two that specifically come to mind).   How many people in this industry can be so lucky as to say that they have been satisfied with their career arc and be so fulfilled as a result thereof?? I feel truly blessed, and am very appreciative that so many Tier 1 opera houses and symphony orchestras have put their trust in me for well over 20 years.  Truly blessed!\n<div class=\"intro\">For more about David, read his very excellent [blog](http://www.davidcangelosi.com/category/blog/), and follow him on Twitter [@DavidCangelosi](https://twitter.com/davidcangelosi).</div>",

Way to go, Cam! I asked the [COC Ensemble Studio member](http://www.coc.ca/aboutthecoc/companymembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx) how it felt:\n\n> I love competing... at sports. Because it doesn't matter what it looks like, what technique they use, who they know... If you're the fastest, the time decides who wins, or you win a boxing match if you outlast your opponent, not if you chose the right trainer or wore the best colour of trunks. As singers, we compete because it's another way to help your career, make new friends and sharpen your craft in a different context. If anything, it's a tool for polishing your audition package, because it's a completely inorganic, unnatural experience for most of us. Some singers just function well in the crook of a piano in their suit or day dress. I'm learning.\n\nTo ask Cam what he's doing with his prize money, bug him at [@Cameron_McPhail](https://twitter.com/Cameron_McPhail). Congrats, darlin'!",

It's conducted by Leslie Dala, a cornerstone Canadian conductor, and directed by Joel Ivany, one of the brilliant minds behind [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/). _Albert Herring_ was the first production performed at the MacMillan Theatre 50 years ago, and so it's a timely return to one of my favourite operas. The show is double-cast, full of UofT students and a few guests, and seeing it twice might not be a bad idea. Tickets can be purchased by calling 416-408-0208, or online [here](http://performance.rcmusic.ca/event/university-toronto-faculty-music-presents-brbritten-albert-herring-2).\n\nOn April 5th, [Essential Opera](http://essentialopera.com/) presents a [triple-bill of new Canadian operas](http://essentialopera.com/new-works/). There's _Etiquette_, with music by Monica Pearce and libretto by the one and only John Terauds; _Regina_, composed by Elisha Denburg with libretto by Maya Rabinovitch; and finally _Heather (Cindy + Mindy = BFs 4ever)_, with music by Christopher Thornborrow and libretto by Julie Tepperman. This is a rare treat outside the walls of [Tapestry Opera](https://tapestryopera.com/), and I can't wait. The show is one night only, April 5, 2014, 8:00pm, Heliconian Hall, 35 Hazelton Lane. Details [here](http://essentialopera.com/new-works/).\n\nNext up is [_Hänsel & Gretel_](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/2014-season/), the Humperdinck favourite that gives me the creeps, presented by [Metro Youth Opera](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca). Metro Youth is direct in its objective: to give performance opportunities to young singers who need experience. That makes it a great company to support, so grab a ticket and go see opera's newest talent. It runs April 25-27th at the Aki Studio Theatre in the Daniels Spectrum Building, 585 Dundas East. To purchase tickets, click [here](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/2014-season/).\n\nBeginning April 5th, the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/) begins its Spring season with the much-anticipated production of Handel's [_Hercules_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/Hercules.aspx), directed by Peter Sellars. The cast includes Alice Coote and Eric Owens, and I blabbed on and on about it [here](http://schmopera.com/hercules-yes-please/). Go, go see it. Next up at the COC in the spring is Donizetti's _[Roberto Devereux](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/RobertoDevereux.aspx)_, opening April 25th. It's Sondra Radvanovsky and Russell Braun. Just go. And finally, the last of the COC's spring hat-trick is Massenet's [_Don Quichotte_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/DonQuichotte.aspx), in which you can hear the venerable Ferruccio Furlanetto sing the lead role. Quinn Kelsey and Ekaterina Gubanova round out the lead cast, so it's safe to say the singing will be spectacular. _Quichotte_ opens May 9, 2014.\n\nWhat are _you_ looking forward to seeing in Toronto this spring?

Violetta's objective during that scene is to get Germont's approval, and Germont's is to get Violetta to leave his son. These two objectives are not equal, and by definition, Violetta has lost right out of the gate. This doesn't sound like an interesting scene, right? But it _is_, because we spend the scene watching the painfully irrelevant details: Violetta's insistence on maintaining a high social status, Germont's dirty yet effective jabs at her fragile self-esteem, and how 19th-century institutions of \"family honour\" and \"sacred bonds\" get the better of Violetta and serve Germont's objective perfectly.\n\nThe famous music that immediately precedes Germont's line, \"Madamigella Valery\" comes to mind at about 2:05:\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHnhAYsodjQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nWhat do you think?

Child opera singer (and human oxymoron) Amira Willighagen will [release her first album](http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2014/03/amira-9-year-old-talent-winner-records-11-opera-arias-for-rapid-release.html), and it's going to be on Simon Cowell's label, [Syco Entertainment](http://www.simoncowellonline.com/syco/4579192368). It features the poor little thing singing things like \"O mio babbino caro\" and dub-over duets with Luciano Pavarotti. Wait, what?\nYup. Amira sings a duet version of \"Nessun dorma\" with Pav's dubbed _and transposed_ voice. I'm not kidding. They sing the whole last half together in unison. It's insane. [Listen](https://soundcloud.com/jacaranda-fm/the-late-and-the-great-sing).\n\nAnyway, the Pavarotti estate will make a formal complaint against Syco for basically _stealing Pavarotti's voice.  _Says [Norman Lebrecht](https://twitter.com/NLebrecht) at _[Slipped Disc](http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2014/03/pavarotti-estate-takes-action-to-stop-illicit-child-duet.html)_, \"They tell us that no permission was requested or granted for use of the recording. Had it been requested, it would not have been granted.\"\n\n[My own opinions on the general offensiveness of child opera singers are clear.](http://schmopera.com/young-pups-and-puccini/) Officially: shame, _shame on you_, Simon Cowell.\n\nBut let's talk for a minute about Syco's reckless use of one of Pavarotti's most famous recordings. Pavarotti's recordings are arguably historical relics, preserving both his honoured voice and the music he sang. So, doesn't it then make sense that they should be public domain?\n\nWhat do you think? Should something as timeless as Pavarotti's \"Nessun dorma\" be under copyright? Or should the glory of Pav be available for all, restriction-free?\n\nAnd here's Amira Willighagen's studio rendition of \"O mio babs.\" You're welcome.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LmSX4Du7h3Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>",

It's a shame. Officially, once again: shame, _shame on you, Simon Cowell_. You stole and exploited from an industry out of which you can afford to buy, and that makes you a cognizant liar.

        "body": "I went to a concert on Tuesday night, one of the [Talisker Players](http://www.taliskerplayers.ca/aboutUs.html)' main concert series at Trinity St. Paul's United Church. I'd never been to see the Talisker Players, but I was lured both by singers Norine Burgess and Geoffrey Sirett, and by the evening's title: _Creature to Creature_. I've done a few animal-themed concerts, and the expressive potential of using animals to tell human stories is unexpected.\n\nThe repertoire was mostly unfamiliar to me, with a couple of exceptions, like Poulenc's cycle _Le bestiaire._ I hadn't heard the version for voice and chamber orchestra, so even that was a new treat for me. The concert featured, among others, sets by Lee Hoiby, Flanders & Swann, and Rossini's inevitable \"Duetto buffo di due gatti\". The programming was great, and I'll jump right in and talk about my favourite set of the evening:\n\nAlexander Rapoport's _archy and mehitabel_ is a set for mezzo-soprano, baritone, flute, clarinet and string trio. The text is by Don Marquis, the guy who wrote the series of newspaper columns [_archy and mehitabel_](http://donmarquis.com/archy-and-mehitabel) starting in 1916\\. Archy is a cockroach who writes poetry on a typewriter too big for him; he types by hurling his whole body at the keys, one at a time. Mehitabel is an alley cat, Archy's friend and unofficial literary critic. Rapoport's setting of selected poems by Don Marquis was curious and odd, but definitely compelling. The two characters were played by singers Geoffrey Sirett (Archy) and Norine Burgess (Mehitabel), and they had moments of dialogue, monologue and philosophizing on their animal states and artistic endeavours. I found it charming, and I'm now kind of obsessed with _archy and mehitabel_.\n\nMezzo-soprano [Norine Burgess](http://www.norineburgess.com/) impressed me with a lovely sound in the Poulenc; I thought her sound was pleasing and rich, and she had surprising ease at the top of her range. Her singing of \"Le carpe,\" the final song in _Le bestiaire_, was still and stunning, and put me in a good mood for the rest of the night. She spent the rest of the night singing in English (I'll discount \"_miao_\"), and I was impressed by the broad range of sound she brought to the stage. She put on accents, showed us clear characters; unfortunately, I had trouble understanding her text, and it clouded her efforts of interpretation. I missed it most in Lee Hoiby's _Rainforest_, a beautiful and difficult set for mezzo-soprano, wind quintet and piano; she thrilled me a times with the power of her instrument, but I just wanted to be able to listen without reading along in my program.\n\nAlso collaborating with the Talisker Players was baritone [Geoffrey Sirett](http://www.geoffreysirett.com/). I'm a big ol' fan of Geoff, and he didn't disappoint me in this concert. He sang fiercely difficult repertoire, including Miriam Gideon's set _Creature to Creature_, with juicy poetry by Nancy Cardozo; in this set Geoff used a huge range of vocal colour (and vocal risk!), delivering every letter of the text with specificity.\n\nBut really, it was in the Flanders and Swann songs that Geoff did what he always does the very best: tell stories. These songs had me in misty-eyed perma-smiles; I never thought a song called \"The Warthog\" would move me so much. And I wanted someone to sing _me_ an armadillo-serenade. I mean, the songs themselves are genius. It really is difficult, however, to articulate the extraordinary thing that happens when Geoff delivers a song. I think the only valuable thing to say would be this: go and hear Geoffrey Sirett sing as soon as possible. (Side note: Geoff and I have crossed professional paths a few times in the last few months, and his depiction of animals is becoming an odd theme. I've seen him as at least two cats and a sheep so far.)\n\nBetween each set, actor [Ross Manson](http://volcano.ca/company_news/company_staffboard.php) delivered selected readings that set up or commented on the evening's music. He read texts by [Lewis Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Thomas), [David Quammen](http://www.davidquammen.com/) and [Caspar Henderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Henderson). I wasn't familiar with the writings, but I loved leaning in and listening to a skilled speaker talk about what humans and animals have in common.\n\nI had a delightful night. The Talisker Players sounded polished and adaptive, and their [artistic goals as an ensemble](http://www.taliskerplayers.ca/aboutUs.html) are exciting to see. Put their series on your concertgoing schedule; at the very least you'll hear polished performers playing something new in a beautiful venue.",

        "body": "So much celebration happened on Thursday night. Director [Joel Ivany](http://www.joelivany.com/index/biography.html) celebrated the opening night of his production of Benjamin Britten's _Albert Herring_ in the MacMillan theatre at the University of Toronto. UofT celebrated the [50th anniversary](http://performance.rcmusic.ca/event/university-toronto-faculty-music-presents-brbritten-albert-herring-2) of its first opera performance in 1964: _Albert Herring_. And of course, everyone celebrated Albert the Good.\n\nI was able to catch the opening night performance of _Albert Herring_ at the University of Toronto, and I'm so glad I did. Thursday night's cast was well-balanced, an important element when presenting what's really an ensemble piece; _Herring_ is a little bit about everyone. Kudos go to Joel Ivany for showing characters that are specific and recognizable; we began to feel as though we had known them for years.\n\n <figure data-type=\"image\">\n ![](/webhook-uploads/1429883385812/JanFinal.jpg)\n <figcaption>Tenor Jan Nato</figcaption>\n </figure>\n\nTenor [Jan Nato](https://twitter.com/jjanissimo) starred as Albert, looking just the part with his small stature, nervous posture, and a hint of a lisp. He showed strong acting skills, giving Albert plenty of chances to earn the audience's sympathy (or pity, perhaps). As he sat at the table at the Mayday Celebration, the juxtaposition of his flowery and ribbony crown next to his sour and emasculated face was a great moment of comedy. Jan also showed that he's got quite the voice to display; although his sound is still young, he found ease and organicism in what can be a difficult score. He was smart about prioritizing text (it was clear!) and character in his singing, but let us hear his lyricism in the few such moments Britten writes for Albert.\n\nBass-baritone [Iain MacNeil](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=25769) was solid as Sid, Albert's bad-influence friend. Based on what I've heard from Iain in the past, Sid is a fairly high role for him; but he did well with it, and maintained all the spontaneity the role demands. He looked and acted the part without effort, and he certainly stood out among the cast as a singer with real stage presence and awareness. I'm curious to hear him as he joins the COC Ensemble Studio for the 2014/15 season, hopefully in roles he'll find a bit more comfortable.\n\nIn the role of Nancy was mezzo-soprano Melissa Peiou. She sang well, but I was left feeling unfulfilled by her character, and I had real trouble understanding her. The role is tricky one in which to establish specificity of character, but I felt that Joel Ivany gave her the tools, and Melissa could have been a \"bigger\" presence onstage.\n\n[Christina Bell](https://twitter.com/ziggy_1089) was delightfully shrill and self-important as Lady Billows. Christina sang with plenty of power, but I sensed a tendency for her to hold back her sound. The role of Lady Billows is a big, ridiculous, vocal hyperbole, and it almost seemed as though Christina didn't quite grasp why Britten's writing is so funny. I'm curious to hear her sing other repertoire, since I'm not convinced I got a good slice of her skills in this particular role.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429883455355/Laurelle.jpeg)\n<figcaption>Mezzo-soprano Laurelle Jade</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nLaurelle Jade was hilariously uppity and self-righteous as Lady Billows' housekeeper, Florence Pike. This role was pretty low for her, and she spent most of the night singing wordy, patter-like lines; she had plenty of tongue-twisting text to deliver, and she pulled it off with poise and plenty of room for character. I've recently gotten to know Laurelle as a singer, and I know that this role doesn't show her real vocal skill. But she took the opportunity to show off her strong acting chops; one of my comic highlights was watching her at the Mayday Celebration, as she fretted and fidgeted, waiting for Albert to make his speech.\n\nAnother highlight was Sonya Gosse as Albert's mum, Mrs. Herring. Sonya is an alumna of the UofT Opera program; it was fitting to have her as a part of this production of _Albert Herring_, and it helped that she was fantastic in the role. She was sufficiently overbearing and attention-hogging without crossing the line of caricature, and I loved watching her throughout the opera's final scene as she \"grieved\" for her lost son. Sonya is a regular member of the COC Chorus, and it was there that I got to know Sonya a bit over the years; it was really great for me to see her in a role that showcased her skills so well.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429883512089/Adanya.jpg)\n</figcaption>Soprano Adanya Dunn</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI thought the quartet of loveable/hatable members of the Mayday committee were some of the most nuanced, specifically presented characters in this production. [Adanya Dunn](http://www.fawnopera.com/collaborating-artists/production-team/) was spectacular as Miss Wordsworth; she gave what I thought was the best singing of the night, and she was just so _teachery_. Bird-like and constantly multi-tasking, she made my night when she took back the pie she'd brought for Albert's grieving mother in the final scene. Charles Sy sang with a warm and endearing voice as Mr. Upfold, the mayor. His tenor sound is still young, but I could hear a real instrument in there, _and I got his text__. _I'm excited to hear him over the next few years as he takes on Mozart and Donizetti. As Mr. Gedge, the vicar, there was something compelling about [Ryan Downey](https://twitter.com/downeysings). He wasn't the strongest singer onstage, but his intention and character were always clear. I liked Dylan Wright as Superintendent Budd; he reminded me of [Tom Corbeil as Swallow](http://ada-artists.com/2013/11/tom-corbeil-is-celebrated-for-his-swallow-in-peter-grimes-at-coc/) in the [COC's 2013 production of ](http://coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/PeterGrimes.aspx)_[Peter Grimes](http://coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/PeterGrimes.aspx)._\n\nThe production was, I thought, exactly what it needed to be. Joel and his team updated the setting to the early 1960s, which didn't offend me. The set and costumes, by designer Camellia Koo, was perfectly British-bland with the right amount of redundant Mayday fluff. With the use of a revolving set (and lighting by Fred Perruzza), we were taken from Lady Billows' sitting room to the Herring's grocery store to the site of the fated Mayday feast. The revolving set did wonders for presenting to the audience a glimpse of action that happened between acts, not written out by Britten for us to see. I won't say the revolving part was crucial, but it really did help with the necessary divisions of time and location.\n\nThe orchestra played admirably under the baton of conductor Leslie Dala, and the singers fared well among Britten's wacky rhythms and questionable chords; kudos to Andrea Grant for musical preparation and to Jason Nedecky for keeping on that cast about clear English diction.\n\n_Albert Herring_ plays at the MacMillan Theatre tonight at 7:30pm, and tomorrow afternoon at 2:30pm.

        "body": "On Sunday, I attended the final show of the season by [Voicebox: Opera in Concert](http://www.operainconcert.com/) at the [St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts](http://www.stlc.com/). They presented Verdi's [_Stiffelio_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffelio#), one of his lesser-known opera written after _Nabucco_ and _Ernani_, but before _La traviata_ and _La forza del destino_. I'd certainly never heard of it, so I was curious.\n\nFor some reason, _Stiffelio_ seemed to me like it had been written much earlier than 1850, but it was really just one year before _Rigoletto_. That 1850 premiere, however, was censored up the wa-zoo, and the textual watering-down made the story kind of lame. But it's worth getting to know the piece; you can start by checking out a score [here](http://sausage.whatbox.ca:15263/imglnks/usimg/1/10/IMSLP24547-PMLP55371-Verdi_-_Stiffelio.pdf) and reading a synopsis [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffelio#Synopsis). I sat through the show, fascinated at what felt like the beta-versions of some of Verdi's most famous music. That aria was so _Il trovatore_. That _tutti_ finale was totally Act 2, scene 2 of _La traviata_. And _Stiffelio_ also looked back at composers to whom Verdi owes his genius; I heard distinct moments of _Lucia di Lammermoor_ and what I'm sure were other nods to Donizetti. Neat.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429882974933/Ernesto-Ramirez-1024x1024.jpg)\n<figcaption>Tenor Ernesto Ramìrez.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe cast featured three solid singers in the three lead roles. [Ernesto Ramìrez](http://www.edgarernestoramirez.com/) sang the title role beautifully, impressively making his way through the difficult vocal writing. I've heard Ernesto sing periodically throughout the last few seasons, and I really enjoyed him in this kind of role. He's always had a warm, almost sweet quality to his sound, and in the role of Stiffelio, he had the chance to show a more fiery side to his instrument. There were moments when his sound had facets of Pavarotti, with plenty of honest and open singing. This is the kind of role that is difficult to pull off in an in-concert setting; to me, it felt similar to Otello in its high vocal demands, made easier by Verdi's expert dramatic trajectories.\n\nSoprano [Laura Albino](http://www.lauraalbino.com/html/slideshow.php) was lovely and strong as Lina, the adulterous minister's wife (love it). I hadn't yet heard her sing Verdi, and I thought it suited her well; Lina is one of those roles where the female lead does some serious growing up between acts I and III, and Laura paced her singing wisely. She went from silvery and submissive at the top of the show, to a rounder, more assured sound that embraced an ever-widening vocal range. Very Gilda. I'm looking forward to hearing her more in this kind of repertoire.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429883015539/LauraA.jpg)\n<figcaption>Soprano Laura Albino.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n[Geoffrey Sirett](http://www.geoffreysirett.com/) sang the role of Count Stankar, Lina's father. The role was another fiercely, almost anti-vocal writing; in his Act III aria, \"O gioia inesprimibile, che questo core inondi!\" Geoff stayed one step ahead of Verdi's incessant and ever-rising lines. To paraphrase a passing post-show comment from Geoff, it was \"the hardest thing I ever sang in my life.\" I believe it. When he wasn't negotiating technical extremes, Geoff showed off his wide colour-palate and dangerous sound, very handy for Verdi baritone roles.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429883064429/SIRETT-PHOTONEW2.jpg)\n<figcaption>Baritone Geoffrey Sirett.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe singers in three supporting roles were fine, although in a noticeably different class of vocal technique in comparison with the leads.  As Raffaele, Lina's lover, tenor [Hassan Anami](http://www.hassananami.com/biography/) sang with plenty of power. He wasn't at ease, however, in Italian, and more attention to diction details will naturally help his technical development. [Fabián Arciniegas](https://twitter.com/fabiolito) appeared as Federico, cousin to Lina. He too showed a strong instrument and fine stage presence, but he didn't take advantage of the natural aesthetic of the Italian language. If he does, he'll discover a lot more vocal ease. As Lina's other cousin, Dorotea, mezzo-soprano [Dina Shikhman](http://iemusicafirenze.blogspot.ca/2013/11/dina-shikhman-young-canadian-soprano.html) showed a lovely, rich sound. She's quite young at 21 years of age, but has plenty of stage experience already, including her time in the Canadian Children's Opera Chorus. I look forward to hearing her as she grows into her voice.\n\nUnder the direction of Robert Cooper, the Voicebox Chorus sang with a precise, stylistic sound. When Cooper joined the chorus to conduct, I thought it was the best music of the afternoon. Music director and pianist [Raisa Nakhmanovich](http://www.operainconcert.com/performers.htm#raisanakhmanovich) played the score confidently, filling out the largeness of sound often needed in Verdi score reductions. Unfortunately, the music suffered from a few missing details, and crucial ones. Nakhmanovich was unsteady in her tempos, and lacked the crisp, precise rhythm that's essential to making Verdi's scores function off the page. At times she didn't take aural cues from the singers who wanted to move a phrase faster, and could have taken more care with balance during some softer moments. But upon a quick glance of the score, it's a bit of a monster to play; performing the piece in one sitting must have felt like an extended piano concerto, and Nakhmanovich showed her experienced piano chops.\n\nI enjoyed myself at Opera in Concert's _Stiffelio_. I liked seeing a new piece by a very familiar composer, and OIC is a good place to catch a lot of Toronto's young operatic talent in one place. They've also just released their 2014/15 season, which looks delightful. It doesn't seem to be on their [website](http://www.operainconcert.com/) yet, but the short of it is this: Manuel de Falla's _La Vida Breve_, Weill's _Street Scene_, Charpentier's _Louise_ and a first reading of _Isis and Osiris_, a new work by composer [Peter-Anthony Togni](http://www.petertogni.com/) and libretto by [Sharon Singer](http://sharonsinger.com/about/), both Canadians.\n\n<div class=\"intro\">Did you catch _Stiffelio_?

        "body": "I went to hear some music by Canadians yesterday at the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, as part of the [Free Concert Series](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/FreeConcertSeries.aspx) (that you should all be checking out!). It was a chance for the public to hear some of the products of the ongoing [Canadian Art Song Project](http://www.canadianartsongproject.ca/), headed by artistic directors [Lawrence Wiliford](http://www.lawrencewiliford.com/) and [Steven Philcox](http://www.music.utoronto.ca/faculty/faculty_members/faculty_n_to_z/steven_philcox.htm).\n\nAt [this particular concert](http://files.coc.ca/pdfs/concert140327.pdf), I had the chance to hear three sets of songs that were entirely new for me, and one world-premiere that was new for everyone. Soprano [Monica Whicher](https://learning.rcmusic.ca/glenn-gould-school/programs-and-faculty/studio-faculty-biographies/monica-whicher) and pianist [Kathryn Tremills](http://www.kathryntremills.com/) began the program with _Dissidence (trois poèmes de Gabriel Charpentier),_ written in 1955 by late composer [Pierre Mercure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Mercure). Throughout the set I was reminded of how much I love Claude Debussy's _Chansons de Bilitis_. The songs had that blurred, impressionistic, and almost modal sound you can hear in Ravel and Poulenc. Monica Whicher sounded beautiful this set, and she was utterly committed to singing every single word. I loved the end of the second song, \"Psaume\", which used a hymn-like steadiness to rise slowly and continuously, grasping upwards in the final words. It was a vocal risk that Monica took, and I'm glad she did. Kathryn's playing was full of specificity, and she maintained a soloistic way of playing that actually helped the singers deliver text in a simple way.\nMonica and Kathryn returned later in the afternoon to perform the world premiere of young Canadian composer [Matthew Emery](http://composermatthewemery.wordpress.com/)'s _Three Songs, _written between 2011-2013\\. I thought they were simply beautiful, spontaneous and improvisatory; Emery also chose wonderful poetry, by Archibald Lampman, Eugene Field and the ever-heartbreaking Oscar Wilde. I was reminded of Samuel Barber and Carlisle Floyd. The communication of these texts was a clear priority for Emery, and Monica again had me hanging on her last word. The music itself had a few pop-inspired chords; I thought of André Previn, and even [Jason Robert Brown](http://jasonrobertbrown.com/). If there were listeners who decided this made Emery's work less legitimate, I was too busy enjoying myself to notice. I thought he treated these special texts with care and lots of heart. At the keys, Kathryn took advantage of the warmth in Emery's harmonies, and Monica simply moved me very, very much with her singing.\n\nKathryn was also joined by celebrated Canadian tenor [Colin Ainsworth](http://www.colinainsworth.ca/), to perform selections from _A Play of Passion_, written in 2012 by [Derek Holman](http://www.musiccentre.ca/node/37210/biography) with texts by Sir Walter Raleigh, Samuel Daniel, Robert Laurence Binyon and James Joyce. It was no easy sing, but Colin took to making his primary task the frankness and clarity of text. Holman set the famous Joyce text, \"I hear an army\" in an uncomfortable, uneasy way that couldn't have been farther from the deafening, cathartic setting by Samuel Barber. I thought Colin was an open and honest orator in this set, taking enormous risks that paid off. I appreciated Kathryn's playing the most in this set; Holman's writing for the piano was of course complementary to the voice, but asked a certain level of autonomy of the player, so that the singer would be free to deliver the poetry. It's often hard for a pianist to identify this type of song, and Kathryn did it beautifully.\n\nThe final set of songs was the world premiere of [James Rolfe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rolfe_(composer))'s _Moths_, with texts by [André Alexis](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/andre-alexis/); _Moths_ was performed by baritone [Brett Polegato](http://www.brettpolegato.com/index.html) and pianist Steven Philcox. James was at the concert, and he spoke briefly about the set. It's really a song cycle, about the experiences of a dreaming person throughout a night of sleep. I loved this premise, and I thought the songs lived up to the grand imaginative scope that comes with dreaming. The songs were schizophrenic, jumping from what felt like bizarre musical jokes to the nagging dread that accompanies a nightmare. I loved the poetry because it used unexpected words like \"electromagnetic\" and \"watermelon\".\n\nSteven's playing was assertive and versatile, and he gave each song its own personality. Brett's singing was inviting and warm; I thought he seemed under-energized in this performance, and it might have been that he chose to use a score. I missed some of the great words, and I noticed it after the clarity I heard in Monica Whicher and Colin Ainsworth. But I liked his reedy sound, and both he and Steven sold me on this song cycle.\n\nStay posted for a look at _[Ash Roses](http://www.musiccentre.ca/node/81884)_, the first commercial recording from the Canadian Art Song Project, featuring the works of Derek Holman. The team of Canadian artists includes soprano [Mireille Asselin](http://www.mireilleasselin.com/), tenor Lawrence Wiliford, harpist Sanya Eng, and pianist [Liz Upchurch](http://www.arts-orford.org/en/academie/professors/liz-upchurch-2/).

It'll be a nice of music and dance, and there will be a special presentation of excerpts from [_A Moveable Beast_](http://volcano.ca/productions/beast/beast.php), a current work in progress from Ross Manson's _[Volcano Theatre](http://volcano.ca/company_news/company_philosophy.php)_. I'll get to hear some great Canadian talent, including singers [Andrew Love](http://imgartists.com/artist/andrew_love), Neema Bickersteth, [Andrea Ludwig](https://tapestryopera.com/node/65) and [Adrian Kramer](https://twitter.com/aitkramer). Looking forward. For more info and to purchase tickets, click [here](https://tapestryopera.com/tap-ex-revolutions).\n\nNext up is my Saturday triple-bill with [Essential Opera](http://essentialopera.com/), at 8pm in Heliconian Hall. I'll get to hear three new Canadian pieces in one night: _Etiquette_, by Monica Pearce and John Terauds, _Regina_, by Elisha Denburg and Maya Rabinovitch , and finally _Heather (Cindy + Mindy = BFs 4ever)_, by Christopher Thornborrow and Julie Tepperman. The short but sweet descriptions about these three pieces make them pretty intriguing, and I'm thrilled about having a new place in which to check out current Canadian work. For more details about Essential Opera's triple bill, click [here](http://essentialopera.com/new-works/).\n\nAnd finally, this Sunday afternoon at 3:30pm will find me watching [Francesco Cavalli's _Giasone_](http://www.torontoconsort.org/season/giasone_background.html), presented by [The Toronto Consort](http://www.torontoconsort.org/about/about.html). I've never seen a piece by Cavalli, and I do enjoy me some Greek mythology, so this should be fun. [Laura Pudwell](http://barczablog.com/2014/03/21/ten4pudwell/) appears in the title role, and conductor [David Fallis](http://www.gtpo.ca/fallis.html) will conduct the period instrument orchestra. _Giasone_ runs April 4th and 5th at 8pm, and April 6th at 3:30pm at Trinity St. Paul's Centre.

I _can_ tell you that it was the inaugural presentation of _Tapestry Explorations: Revolutions_, and that it left an impression on me.  The evening seemed to evolve on its own accord, beginning with understated and subtle entrances by performers [Neema Bickersteth](https://tapestryopera.com/node/69), [Andrew Love](/talking-to-singers-andrew-love/), [Andrea Ludwig](https://tapestryopera.com/node/65) and [Adrian Kramer](https://tapestryopera.com/node/66). They began spread out across the space, behind and among the audience. As they moved throughout the space and embodied different \"characters\" with each piece, they pulled your attention across the room. These four were simply pros. Choreographer [Marie-Josée Chartier](http://www.chartierdanse.com/) provided a beautiful movement aesthetic, always organic to the body but never predictable. The effect of Chartier's movements, exercised by these expert performers, had my rapt attention. At times I felt torn, unable to watch two places at once.  They took the audience through a fluid, riveting experience and I couldn't take my eyes off them.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429843578968/Gregory.jpg)\n<figcaption>Pianist Gregory Oh.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe first part was pretty fascinating. It started with pianist and Tapestry Music Director [Gregory Oh](http://gregoryoh.com/) playing _Primitive_, by John Cage; it's a work for [prepared piano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_piano), and it was performed with movements Neema Bickersteth. I have a soft spot for John Cage, and Gregory's playing was pretty awesome. After that, there were two chorale excerpts by J.S. Bach, \"Jesu, meine Freude\" and \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\", which bookended a cool scene of operatic existentialism.\n\nOperatic characters of Gounod, Leoncavallo, Mozart and Puccini were conversing, using just lines from their arias; it culminated in a battle of wits, arranged by Benton Roark, between Tamino (the guy with _The Magic Flute_) and Silvio (of _Pagliacci_ fame). It felt light and clever at the start, and became almost tragic; it's a little heartbreaking to see Tamino start to question if Pamina is real or not.  Finally, when the four singers began the final Bach chorale, it felt like a scene of communal support in crisis; but then the four of them started walking away from each other, finally singing quietly, to themselves, in what felt like a a scared prayer.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429843536527/Neema.jpg)\n<figcaption>Soprano Neema Bickersteth.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe second half was just as mesmerizing, and I heard music with which I was almost entirely unfamiliar. Neema Bickersteth began the second part with Rachmaninoff's famous \"Vocalise\" and she made me hear it differently with movements that felt slightly dangerous; she returned with another vocalise later, this time Reza Jacobs' \"Vocalise for Nema\". This piece was a selection from [Volcano Theatre's ](http://volcano.ca/productions/beast/beast.php)_[A Moveable Beast](http://volcano.ca/productions/beast/beast.php), _and Neema reminded me of what can be said with simply the sound of the voice.\n\nI had the chance to fall in love a few of the pieces on the program. The most obvious were the three selections by [Georges Aperghis](http://www.aperghis.com/); they were some of the most captivating and charming moments of the night. Andrea Ludwig performed \"Recitation #14\", and she made me feel as though I'd walked in on someone's most private thoughts. [\"Ses muscles\"](http://books.google.ca/books?id=Md8kDOCKwGMC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=george+aperghis+ses+muscles&source=bl&ots=N5QoUkpGK0&sig=Q080O1SBSOok-CVC7XKtFmuSD5Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qW5BU8C7LYiF2QXPvYGIDQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=george%20aperghis%20ses%20muscles&f=false) was done by all four performers, and while I won't pretend to know what it was about, it was delightful and funny for some reason and must have been pretty hard to memorize. In a powerful excerpt of [Andrew Staniland](http://andrewstaniland.com/music/opera-vocal/)'s [_Ashlike on the Cradle of the Wind_](http://www.musiccentre.ca/node/28093) , Adrian Kramer was eery and predatory, and Andrew Love was his half-willing prey. Cool piece, give that link a click.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429843481344/AndrewLove.jpeg)\n<figcaption>Baritone Andrew Love.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn his first season as Artistic Director of Tapestry New Opera Works, [Michael Mori](https://tapestryopera.com/michael-mori) has already impressed me. _Revolutions_ was, to put it simply, damn creative. It made redundant any questions about choice of repertoire, casting the right singer and being \"stylistic\". In a quick chat with the audience, Mori spoke about opera's evolution on the large and small scales; with a nod to the \"grand\" (think [Robert Carsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Carsen), [Robert Lepage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lepage)), he expressed his curiosity with the evolution of the artists themselves:\n\n> Most young and vital operatic performers, such as our extraordinary cast, study and perform mostly hundred year old European opera, although they are expressive and diverse living Canadians! For opera to evolve and to thrive again, the repertoire must converse with current culture and arts, and Tapestry is a willing revolutionary.\"\n\n_Revolutions_ was refreshing and encouraging to see. I think it might be my favourite Tapestry show so far. Congratulations, guys!",

        "body": "This past weekend, [Essential Opera](http://essentialopera.com/) achieved a true feat in the Canadian opera scene: they presented a triple bill of Canadian works, all brand new. It was really exciting to see an event like this in Toronto; to hear Canadian opera, you most likely need to attend something involving [Tapestry New Opera Works](https://tapestryopera.com/). But Essential Opera has put themselves on the map in its new contributions to Canada's operatic repertoire, and I give them a bravo for that.\nThe triple bill featured premieres of _Etiquette_, (music by [Monica Pearce](http://www.monicapearce.com/) and libretto by [John Terauds](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.musicaltoronto.org%2Fauthor%2Fjohn-terauds%2F&ei=jGNDU6e5BYOY2QXunoHwCw&usg=AFQjCNFNnmjtwDRk-Q6R7jobPzZZlPJucA&bvm=bv.64367178,d.b2I)) _Regina_ (music by [Elisha Denburg](http://elishadenburg.com/) and libretto by [Maya Rabinovitch](https://twitter.com/MyRabs)) and _Heather: Cindy + Mindy = BFFs 4EVR_ (music by [Chris Thornborrow](http://www.christhornborrow.com/Chris_Thornborrow/Home.html) and libretto by [Julie Tepperman](http://www.playwrightscanada.com/index.php/authors/s-u/julie-tepperman.html)). I was able to stay for the first two pieces, and for info about _Heather_, you can watch [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-DKabC6yhY), or check out composer [Chris Thornborrow's website](http://www.christhornborrow.com/Chris_Thornborrow/Home.html).\n\nEssential Opera founders [Maureen Batt](http://maureenbatt.com/) and [Erin Bardua](http://www.erinbardua.com/) showed their vocal chops as the lead roles in these premieres; it was my first EO show, and I found them both sweet and expressive singers. I especially liked Maureen as _New Yorker_ critic [Dorothy Parker](http://flavorwire.com/202873/our-favorite-lines-from-dorothy-parkers-most-scathing-reviews/) in _Etiquette_, with her prickly typewriter aria. I thought Erin was stoic and magnetic in _Regina_, as [Regina Jonas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina_Jonas), the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi. I liked the rest of the cast, which included mezzo-soprano [Julia Morgan](http://www.juliamorganmezzo.com/) and baritones Keith O'Brien and [Jesse Clark](http://www.hncmanagement.com/jesse-clark). The  orchestra sounded great under music director and pianist [Cheryl Duvall](http://www.cherylduvall.com/).\n\nHere's the thing: I think I saw two Canadian operas that I enjoyed, but a few things got in my way from saying I really enjoyed the evening. I'm always slightly put off by preambled announcements at concerts (turn off your phone and all that), but I understand the importance of public thanks to the right people. Throughout the night, though, the show kept getting stopped by speech that wasn't really that interesting and was at times redundant for anyone who had picked up a program.\n\nBefore each opera there was a brief interview with each respective work's composer and librettist; I know this was meant to act as a listening guide for the audience, setting up the piece for its debut performance. It was something that should really have its own medium, like a pre-show chat, aside from the presentation of the works themselves. Simply put, I was excited to hear some new music, and the preamble seemed unnecessary and ever so slightly pretentious.\n\n_Etiquette_ began the night, and it was a clever, interesting story that piqued my attention right away. [Dorothy Parker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Parker) (Maureen Batt), critic at the_The New Yorker_, writes her opinions on the latest edition of [\"Etiquette\", by Emily Post](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14314/14314-h/14314-h.htm#CHAPTER_III). Amid the defiant review, Emily Post herself has tea with [Lady Nancy Astor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Astor,_Viscountess_Astor) (Julia Morgan), the first woman in Parliament, natch. They converse about social mores in print and in practicum. The libretto by [John Terauds](https://twitter.com/JohnTerauds) and music by [Monica Pearce](http://www.monicapearce.com/) worked beautifully together, telling us specifics about each character. I particularly liked Terauds' verbal aesthetic for _Etiquette_; he successfully captured the mindful, calculated opinions made publicly by women in the early 20th century.\n\n_Regina_ is based on the true story of [Regina Jonas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina_Jonas), the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi. Elisha Denburg's score was beautiful and flexible, and the music succeeded in keeping the libretto's parallel stories separated or intertwined as necessary. Maya Rabinovitch's libretto was a little vague at times, but some of the text was obscured by a few too many people speaking at once in some ensemble sections.\n\nOne issue that took away from my experience of both _Regina_ and _Etiquette_ was the fact that the text just wasn't clear. It's true that in both pieces, there were instances of some tricky writing by the composers, making it difficult for the singer to deliver lines naturally. I'm sympathetic to how hard it is for a singer to balance healthy singing with clear text, but I know it's possible. Most of the singers (with the exception of mezzo Julia Morgan) just needed to enunciate more clearly. These operas were in English, and we were in a fairly small space, and I don't think it's a big step to get to a point where no subtitles (these were side-titles, actually) would be needed at all.  With some help from the composers, I think these pieces could have stood more strongly on their own with a more detailed delivery from the cast.\n\nSo, my personal irritations aside, I really have to give that nod to Essential Opera for their success with this triple bill. It's a big deal for three (_three!_) new Canadian operas to have their premiere in a night. I was really impressed with the music I heard, and I suggest listening to [more of Elisha Denburg](http://elishadenburg.com/?page_id=64), and[ some of Monica Pearce's projects](http://www.monicapearce.com/music.html).\n\nDid you catch the Essential Opera's Triple Bill?

        "body": "On Thursday night I went to see the Tafelmusik orchestra perform with Canadian soprano [Isabel Bayrakdarian](http://bayrakdarian.com/) in a concert with a good title: _Rival Queens_.\n\nThe queens in this case are 18th-century operatic divas [Francesca Cuzzoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Cuzzoni) and [Faustina Bordoni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faustina_Bordoni), who were in a famous feud throughout their careers, resulting in [onstage catfights and general shallow rivalry](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/whine-women-and-song-the-bitter-rivalry-of-handels-divas-816644.html). Tafelmusik and Isabel Bayrakdarian gave us some orchestral music and arias by composers like Handel, Vivaldi, Bononcini, Hasse and Telemann, who had written music specifically for these divas. It was a great programme, and you can have a look at it [here](http://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/concert/rival-queens-isabel-bayrakdarian).\n\nI absolutely loved watching and listening to the Tafelmusik orchestra. They _listened _ to each other, and you could see beautiful moments of chamber music between different instruments. They played Telemann's Concerto in D Minor, (TWV53:d1, for the curious) and it was one of those orchestra dance-off pieces, where the strings do something and the winds try to one-up them. I remembered how _fun_ that music is. And when they began the second half with Vivaldi's Concerto for strings in G Minor, (RV.153!), I was reminded of how Vivaldi really was a rock star. Tafelmusik, bravo.\n\nCanadian soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian took on the large task of singing arias written for these two attention-hungry divas. The first half was dedicated to music written for Faustina Bordoni, and the second half was given to Francesca Cuzzoni. In fact, Isabel added a Cuzzoni aria to the programme, stating that, for fairness' sake, she wanted to give each singer an equal number of arias. Isabel has worked quite a lot with Tafelmusik in the past, and you could see the chamber music chemistry extend to include her when she joined the orchestra onstage; it was fun to watch her enjoy their playing.\n\nShe got off to a shaky start, jumping right into some ridiculous coloratura at a pretty brave pace. For the rest of the night, and for reasons unknown to me, most of the arias she sang all had quick tempos and about a bazillion notes. I hadn't ever thought of Isabel as a coloratura soprano, and these particular arias weren't exactly forgiving. It made for an exciting night of vocal Olympics, but all the scales and arpeggios didn't leave Isabel much room to just _sing_. Her coloratura was quick, sure, but it was also faked. She was fidgeting all over the place, reminding me of [Cecilia Bartoli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rISjBGOtHhs), and she couldn't seem to stand still. I'll happily grant that those arias sounded pretty hard, and I'm definitely not able to sing it; but I do know that standing still is a good start when singing plenty of notes.\n\nIsabel had moments of exciting vocal power, and she really did invest energy in singing with a broad palate of colours. Unfortunately for the most part, I could hear that she wasn't fully comfortable singing these arias. When she had a chance to really sing with her voice and express, she allowed her dramatic intent to take away from her technique. For example, she sang as an encore, Handel's \"Piangerò la sorte mia\" from _Giulio Cesare,_ which she has [recorded with Tafelmusik](http://www.amazon.com/Isabel-Bayrakdarian-Cleopatra-George-Frideric/dp/B000641ZEK) in 2004\\. You could tell immediately that Isabel had explored the possibilities of expression with her voice; the execution, however, included morphing vowels and wonky intonation. Isabel simply didn't have the technical facility to sing this kind of repertoire _and_ avoid its many traps.\n\nI enjoyed hearing the Tafelmusik orchestra, but I clearly wasn't sold on this performance by Isabel. if I've piqued your curiosity, there are two more performances of _Rival Queens,_ April 12th and 13th.

        "body": "Friday night, I went to a workshop presentation given by Fawn Opera & New Music. They presented three excerpts from their latest operatic project, [_L'homme et le ciel_](http://www.fawnopera.com/creators-of-lhomme-et-le-ciel/) by Canadian composer Adam Scime, with text by Ian Koiter with a French translation by Eric Démoré. The libretto is based on the 2nd-century Christian literary text, \"The Shepherd of Hermas\"; Hermas is a Roman slave who realizes he has feelings for Rhoda, his mistress. I liked how Fawn Opera put it on the program: \"A classic tale of one man's struggle to live righteously.\"\n\nI loved the music. It was eery and primordial, and for all the mysterious sounds Scime devised, you could always \"hear through it\". The score was always in a comfortable motion, similar to the wavy feeling of _Pelléas et Mélisande_. Scime used acoustic and electronic sounds that jived together in a surprisingly natural way; maybe it was because the acoustic instruments often used their respective extended techniques (read: cool sound effect), so the limits of traditional instruments were already blurred. His writing for the voice seemed well-informed and organic, including his French text-setting, and I heard moments that reminded me of Debussy, Messiaen and Saariaho. It's significant that Fawn Opera & New Music presented a Canadian opera in French, I think it's the first Canadian piece I've seen in a while that's really got legs. I'm really looking forward to seeing the whole opera.\n\nScime also wrote well for the singers, giving Hermas pensive, understated lines as well as stretchy, yearning phrases for any baritone to enjoy. For the women, Scime wrote some juicy dissonances and winding duets, blurring the distinction between voices and evoking a dream beautifully. It all felt like one of those dreams that wasn't quite a nightmare, but was certainly unsettling. I loved it.\n\nThe cast was small but mighty, featuring three young and promising singers. Baritone Giovanni Maria Spanu beautifully sang the role of Hermas, the Roman slave; his voice has a way of drawing you towards him, and I thought the French libretto suited his sound well. [Larissa Koniuk](http://bicycleopera.com/artists/co-founders/) was ethereal and sporadically eerie as Rhoda, the object of Hermas' desire. She sang with a clear and bright sound, and it made me remember [Krisztina Szabò](http://www.krisztinaszabo.com/) as Pèlerin in [Saariaho's ](http://definitelytheopera.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/saariaho-at-coc/) _[L'amour de loin](http://definitelytheopera.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/saariaho-at-coc/)_ at the Canadian Opera Company. Finally, soprano [Adanya Dunn](http://www.fawnopera.com/collaborating-artists/production-team/) (and Fawn Opera collaborating artist) was awesome and powerful as the Messenger, filling the performance space with exciting sound. Her first sounds came from behind hanging, translucent panels that filled the stage, and the result gave me goosebumps.\n\nThe orchestra deserves a hand: music director, pianist and conductor [Patrick Murray](http://patrickmurraymusic.net/) led the [Thin Edge New Music Collective](http://www.thethinedgenewmusiccollective.com/) through a night of very cool sounds. Kudos go especially for Cheryl Duvall for her inside-the-piano fun.\n\nStage director and Fawn Opera Artistic Director [Amanda Smith](http://www.fawnopera.com/collaborating-artists/production-team/) made a little go a long way with this presentation. Her simple set worked in tandem with multimedia projections by [Brady Bothwell](http://bradybothwell.com/); the projections showed up on the hanging panels I mentioned earlier, so they appeared to change colour and texture. It suited the affect of the music beautifully. It's something that I noticed about _L'homme et le ciel_, and that's that everyone was on the same aesthetic page. The music, the singers' performance, the set design, they were all congruent. I think that's quite rare, and it's probably what made _L'homme_ jive for me.\n\nAlso, fun fact: I went to Western University (née the University of Western Ontario) with Adam Scime, Ian Koiter and Eric Démoré. Western, makin' waves.\n\nDid you catch Fawn Opera's _L'homme et le ciel_? Let us know what you thought in the comments below!",

I had just performed in our school district’s Speech and Drama Festival and scored a near perfect mark for my portrayal of the Big Bad Wolf (of “Three Little Pigs” fame) telling the true account of what happened with those mischievous swine.\n\n“Are you sure that’s what you want to do?” asked my mother. “Yup.” replied a pretty self-satisfied eleven-year-old me. “Why don’t you get a real job, and do that on the side?” she asked. “Acting IS a real job.” I replied.\n\nThe next fall I was enrolled in drama lessons and the rest is history.\n\nIf you had told that eleven-year-old Gregory that he would one day grow up to be not just an opera singer, but a pretty damn busy one – he would have laughed at you, said he hated opera and then would ask you to play Nintendo. Well look at me now kiddo, I’m averaging twelve to fifteen shows a year, with no representation. I got here by way of theatre, then musical theatre. Summers were spent at theatre camps, and winters spent in classes and lessons and rehearsals. By the time I was 18 I was the quintessential black-clad, dark haired, pale faced theatre-snob. Thankfully I was funny as heck.\n\nI moved to Toronto in 2005 and sang in my first chorus ([Toronto Mendelssohn Choir and Singers](http://tmchoir.org/)) in 2006\\. I made my Toronto debut in A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum the next year at [Hart House](http://harthouse.ca/hart-house-theatre/). Since then, my voice has taken me on a roller-coaster of a career path, until it settled back home, where I started singing “classical” baritone. No, I’m not a household name. No, I haven’t been profiled by [Opera Canada](http://www.operacanada.ca/) or [Barihunks](http://barihunks.blogspot.ca/) (although I’m now Facebook friends with the latter). But I have sung everything from Tallis’ _Motet in Forty Parts_ and Mozart’s [_Le nozze di Figaro_](http://www.againstthegraintheatre.com/shows/figaro) (a LOT), to the Canadian premiere of [_Jerry Springer: The Opera_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Springer:_The_Opera) and the world premiere of _Kamouraska_ by Charles Wilson. I’ve been blessed that I’ve been able to have such a busy, fulfilling schedule with minimal auditioning. I’m a “repeat offender” with most companies I’ve worked with ([Toronto Operetta Theatre](http://www.torontooperetta.com/), [Against The Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/), [Opera In Concert](http://www.operainconcert.com/), [Opera By Request](http://operabyrequest.ca/wordpress/) and [LooseTea Music Theatre](http://looseteamusictheatre.com/)) which has given me the chance to work with the best in the industry.\n\nHow? Acting.\n\nThe thing a lot of us get caught up in when presenting our beloved art is the fact that it is theatre first, but the music is the most important thing. Follow me? No? Good.\n\nThe definition I use when people ask me to talk about opera is this: an opera is a play set to music where the dialogue is completely sung. The key point being that, it is and always will be a play. In the case of Opera, the playwright is now more than one person. The playwright is both the composer and the librettist, and the proper interpretation involves the language of music and the employ of good vocal technique. Let’s not forget the importance of good vocal technique for the theatre actor as well. Heightened speech, such as that needed for theatre acting or orating is just as physically demanding as singing. Believe it or not, it’s actually quite difficult to sustain speech to “the back of the hall” and it’s a challenge that a lot of singers presented with spoken dialogue struggle with.\n\nI was once in a masterclass with Carrol Anne Curry who said that the four pillars of a great operatic voice are Truth, Beauty, Depth, and Grandeur. I thought that was effing brilliant! Truth – the story, Beauty – the voice, Depth – its artful manipulation, Grandeur – the “size” of a voice. Before we get up in arms, I put “size” in quotation marks for a reason. Even the lightest soprano or tenor can have a largesse that carries them over the pit to the back of the “[fifth ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Seasons_Centre)”.\n\nWhat I really wanted to point out, was that in my opinion – someone who works regularly in the field – and that of an expert who gives master classes on the subject believe that the Truth of the story will only enhance the musical experience for both performers and audience members alike. It’s this Truth that has everyone leaving the house satisfied and lining up to buy tickets to the next production.\n\nComposers wrote opera for the theatre. Even if it was to be performed in a court ballroom, it was still acted out, in costumes, with props, etc. For us to assume that they didn’t take all this into account in writing the score would be ludicrous. They knew the art form very well and wrote for it accordingly. You can feel Cio-Cio San’s fidelity and longing in the underscoring as she waits for Pinkerton.\n\nAs artists we have a duty to our audiences who are coming to the opera to present them amazing theatre with scores written by the best composers there were and are. _Even if_ the scores aren’t great, or the text blows, or any number of other rationalizations we as performers find to excuse why we think people don’t want to come to the opera anymore, _this is our profession_. We do this better than anyone else and it’s part of the job to do the proper work on everything. Bad material and antiquated approaches aren’t helping matters, but Opera audiences are waning and that’s not the reason. The reason is we’re failing them. We’re giving them beautiful music, without the theatre – and that’s not what they paid to see. Trust me, I’ve felt the difference between an audience listening to you and an audience feeling with you – and it’s something that I wouldn’t trade for anything.\n\nYes, all the performing arts are feeling the crunch. There are a few standout companies, across all platforms that are clearly bringing people in. A large part of their successes are subject matter for another discussion, but they’re getting butts in the seats by delivering a consistently satisfying theatrical experience for their audiences. We all have to get back to that and with certain new, young companies driving that focus shift, we’re in good hands. We just need more hands. A lot more hands, and get on with presenting Truth, Beauty, Depth and Grandeur through music and text.\n\nAnd always remember: “The play’s the thing.”",

        "body": "_Ash Roses_ is the first CD released by the [Canadian Art Song Project](http://www.canadianartsongproject.ca/) (CASP), and it features the music of composer [Derek Holman](http://www.musiccentre.ca/node/37210/biography). I'm not personally familiar with Holman's work, but I caught some at the CASP recital in the [Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre](http://www.coc.ca/performancesandtickets/freeconcertseries.aspx) a few weeks ago, and I distinctly remember liking it. The album features Canadian singers [Mireille Asselin](http://www.mireilleasselin.com/) and [Lawrence Wiliford](http://www.lawrencewiliford.com/), co-founder of the Canadian Art Song Project (with Steven Philcox), with pianist [Liz Upchurch](http://www.standrewsartscouncil.nb.ca/faculty/lizupchurch.htm) and harpist Sanya Eng.\n\nThe first set, _The Four Seasons_ was commissioned by the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/) in memory of Richard Bradshaw; Lawrence Wiliford and Liz Upchurch premiered it in 2009 at the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre. The cycle uses texts by cornerstone English poets like Shakespeare, Hardy, and Tennyson, and the poems are ordered by season, starting with winter and ending with autumn. Says Holman in his program notes, it was \"an echo of Richard's strength and optimism: 'If winter comes, can spring be far behind?'\"\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429842539150/Lawrence.jpg)\n<figcaption>Tenor Lawrence Wiliford.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI liked this set; it had a transparent texture, keeping the text unobscured. The songs are frank, with never more bars than needed, but Holman always leaves space for real enjoyment of the words. In this set I was reminded of Dominick Argento and Gerald Finzi, perhaps because of the poems chosen. \"Summer Thirst\" is one of my favourites, starting off not-so-subtly as a drinking song, and delivered as a defiant philosopher.\n\nLawrence sounds beautifully clear, just like he's speaking, risking plenty to give us every word. He had moments of gorgeous soft singing, but showed off lots of power, like in the final song, \"The West Wind\". Liz's playing matched Lawrence's clarity and precision, but she got to show us her chops as well. In \"Towering Camelot\" and \"The West Wind\" I thought of Rachmaninoff, Chopin and Prokofiev; Liz always enjoyed the rolling bass lines (and so did I).\n\nThe title set, _Ash Roses_, is sung by Canadian soprano Mireille Asselin, with Liz Upchurch again at the piano. The set was premiered in 1995 at the University of Toronto by [Karina Gauvin](http://karinagauvin.com/) and [Michael McMahon](http://www.mcgill.ca/music/about-us/bio/michael-mcmahon). The texts are by Canadian poet Tricia Postle, who was a U of T student at the time Derek Holman was starting to write a song cycle for Gauvin. The songs are brilliant, almost schizophrenic, and definitely funny when they should be. I spent the whole set saying to myself, \"No, I think _this_ is my favourite.\" \"Maze\" is about finding one's way, and I actually found it sort of sexy. \"Sweet Breath at Night\" is a bit of black comedy, about the possibility of panthers being in one's bedroom (and the possibility of senility). The word-painting in this song was so obvious it was brilliant. In this song, Liz proved she's a chameleon at the keys, and Mireille got to show off her fiery coloratura and enormous palate of colour. She also sang my favourite out-of-context line of the album: \"Drinking from the toilet bowl.\"Out of the six songs, however, \"Arabesque\" stood out for me. It's an exquisitely built poem, using old devices like threefold repetition and an ever-growing refrain. Holman sets it in no hurry, lingering over these words exactly as I needed. Mireille's singing is just _beautiful._\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429842591174/Mireille-816x1024.jpg)\n<figcaption>Soprano Mireille Asselin.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nI loved the duet, _Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal_, sung by Lawrence and Mireille. The Tennyson text was set like a dialogue, each voice passing off alternating lines of text. When they did sing together, they created pulling harmonies that reminded me of Richard Strauss or John Duke. The dialogue-like setting made me look at this poem differently; it started to feel like a real conversation between two people, and it really did double the impact.\n\nThe final set on the album is _Three Songs for High Voice and Harp_, set to texts by [Thomas Hardy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy), E.H. Thomas and [A.E. Housman](http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/631). The songs premiered in 2011 by Lawrence Wiliford and Sanya Eng at U of T, and Lawrence and Sanya returned to record them for _Ash Roses_. The first two songs, \"Midnight on the Great Western\" and \"Adlestrop\" are poems that storytelling style, like old ballads. Lawrence enjoys playing the role of storyteller, and he sings this set with care and skill. With expansive chords, Sanya instantly creates this \"once upon a time\" feeling, like we were all sitting down by a fire to hear some tall tales. These two songs were stories about travellers, and in both, Sanya seems to evoke the sound of a dreamy passenger train. Holman dedicates the final song, \"Loveliest of Trees\", to his wife Margaret. It has a bit of a minstrel-song feel to it, but a bit more celestial-sounding, and with some surprising harmonies. Lawrence sings this song particularly beautifully.\n\nIt's clear that the Canadian Art Song Project is not starved for excellent artists. Their first album release is a successful start to what I hope will be a trend of recording more and more Canadian music. You can help make that happen by picking up a copy of _Ash Roses_ online at [Canadian Music Centre](http://www.musiccentre.ca/node/81884), or [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/holman-ash-roses/id840876792).",

It's directed by the one-of-a-kind [Peter Sellars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellars), conducted by the brilliant [Harry Bicket](http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/conductors/harry-bicket), and [Eric Owens](http://imgartists.com/artist/eric_owens) and [Alice Coote](http://imgartists.com/artist/alice_coote) star as the soldier and soldier's wife. Beautiful. And it really was a stunning spectacle, one with an uncomfortably true message. [I saw Sellars speak about this production](/peter-sellars-all-my-subtexts-were-understatements/), and what it tells us about the effect of war, absence and PTSD have on a solider and his family. Based on Sophocles' play _Women of Trachis_, Handel's _Hercules_ really is about the hero's family. It's clear that both Sophocles and Handel knew that as well; Hercules himself sings little in comparison with his wife Dejanira, his son Hyllus and his prisoner, Iöle.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429839218736/0437-Dejanira-Iole-Credit-Michael-Cooper-1024x681.jpg)\n</figcaption>Alice Coote and Luce Crowe. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI'll admit right away that I had seen the dress rehearsal of _Hercules_, and so it wasn't necessarily all new for me. But I'd sat in the orchestra level for the dress, and my tickets for the other night were on the third ring; I had a much better view of the set, and it illuminated a lot in Sellars' story that I hadn't caught upon my first look. With crumbling pillars, set designer [George Tsypin](http://georgetsypin.com/www/) made us thinking of ancient Greece; the pillars surrounded a big pit of what look like glowing embers, and a huge, transforming backdrop behind it all. The embers and backdrop turned different colours and textures, acting like a chameleon to the drama onstage. With lighting designer [James F. Ingalls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_F._Ingalls), Tsypin's set became like a second chorus, telling the audience what the characters were feeling, even if they couldn't express it for themselves.\n\nThe cast was spectacular, with the unbelievable Alice Coote in the foreground. As Hercules' wife, Dejanira, she was stunning, heartbreaking, and with thirteen arias to sing, her vocal stamina was almost _herculean_ (had to). From her first \"O, Hercules\" to her final and extraordinary mad scene, Alice was the stuff of this opera. The whole theatre could empathize with Dejanira's story. We saw her miss her husband and finally see him at last, and we saw her realize he was not the same man. She was a beautiful actor who took us through a complicated dramatic arc, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her. She sang with weeping legato or determined coloratura, and she didn't shy away from making an ugly sound if the scene warranted it. Her mad scene was truly mad, and her final shrieking phrases terrified me. _She was so good_.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429839272084/0585-Hyllus-Iole-Credit-Michael-Cooper-681x1024.jpg)\n<figcaption>Richard Croft and Lucy Crowe. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe second star of the evening was soprano [Lucy Crowe](http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/singers/soprano/lucy-crowe) as Iöle, the foreign princess whose father was killed by Hercules, and was taken as \"spoils of war\". Lucy has one of the most honest and compelling voices I've heard in a long time. It's not the most perfectly polished voice, but she was enormously expressive in her singing. Her first aria was sung largely with her head covered by a black hood, and still I felt for her. From her hysterical first entrance (kind of like back-to-back mini mad scenes) to her final wise words of comfort to the widowed Dejanira, Lucy was a singing actor the whole time. Sellars made a lot out of this character that may have been missed in other productions, in particular Iöle's interactions with Hercules' family.\n\nGrammy Award-winning bass-baritone Eric Owens made his COC debut in the title role, and I couldn't help noticing that Handel hadn't written Hercules to be chatty. The role was about demonstrating distance between him and his wife, and Eric succeeded in doing that; it was clear when he first stepped onstage that he was not someone with whom Dejanira had anything in common, and it was a painful realization for both of them. I got frustrated with Hercules' inability to communicate or emote, which I think means Eric did his job. Vocally, I was less sold on Eric than the rest of the cast. He had plenty of power, and he too risked ugly sounds for the sake of text; but he didn't seem to fit as easily into the Handel style as others in the cast. Eric's vibrato tended to get a bit wild and wide, and at times it made it hard for me to tell what pitch he was actually singing; it obscured the few moments of coloratura he had. I also wasn't sold on his audible sounds of pain during Hercules' death scene; I'm assuming Sellars asked for them, and Eric did so intelligently, without wrecking his throat for his last bit of singing. But the problem was that Eric's singing voice is so powerful that anything else sounds weak in comparison. I think Handel wrote the death scene with a few problems for directors, but I don't think that hearing audible screams actually added to the scene in this context.\n\nAs Hyllus, Hercules' son, [Richard Croft](http://imgartists.com/artist/richard_croft) was a total pro. His aria at the top of the second act, \"From celestial seats descending\" was simple and drew me towards him. He also had some brilliant moments of coloratura, which was like a machine-gun, healthily sung, and completely a Richard Croft-ism. Hyllus is a tricky, somewhat thankless role, but Richard sang it wisely and created an endearing character. In this production, Hyllus walks with the help of crutches; I didn't think it was a necessary detail, and it made him seem more pathetic than he needed to be, but Richard's great singing took most of my attention, and Sellars' take on the role of Hyllus didn't bug me.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429839324631/0802-Hercules-Credit-Michael-Cooper-719x1024.jpg)\n<figcaption>Eric Owens in Peter Sellars' Hercules. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAmerican counter-tenor [David Daniels](http://www.danielssings.com/) sang the role of the herald Lichas, and it was treat for me to hear him sing live. He sang the first aria of the evening, and he truly set the bar for what this cast was able to do with the _da capo _form. Lichas spends most of his time onstage acting as a sympathetic friend to Dejanira, or as a dramatic liaison for the audience. Those are tricky dramatic intentions to play, but David wisely let his voice to the work. He sang with a career's worth of understanding of this music, and with a warm, empathetic sound. He was another Handel pro, and I hope this COC debut of his won't be his last visit to Toronto.\n\nThe music for the whole evening was stunning. Harry Bicket expertly led the COC orchestra like it was a chamber ensemble, finding hidden solo lines for us to hear and giving room for each singer to do what they do best. The COC Chorus really sounded fantastic. In _Hercules_, the chorus is used in the Greek-chorus style, commenting on the action by the leads, and telling the audience about the characters' true feelings. Sellars used gestures as a form of choreography with the chorus, associating a motion with a specific word, or even a syllable (\"tyrant\" had two separate gestures, eg.). I wasn't fully convinced by the execution, but the gestures definitely made me listen differently to the music. I could literally see the counterpoint in the chorus music, especially the \"Jealousy\" chorus right before intermission. It was really effective.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429839391127/0941-Scene-from-Hercules-Credit-Michael-Cooper-1024x595.jpg)\n<figcaption>Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe chorus also brings up a final thought on this piece. Their costumes (by costume designer Dunya Ramicova) most clearly demonstrated Sellars' conception of time and place in his _Hercules_. Some of the chorus wore amy tee-shirts and camouflage pants, some of the women wore wore Grecian-style gowns, and some men wore retro-looking outfits that reminded me a little of Sellars' own fashion style. The span of associations with these symbolic costumes is telling us that this story of soldiers, returning home from war, hopelessly disconnected from their lives at home with their families, is a story that is timeless. I personally got that message despite a few of the details onstage that were very time-specific, like a barbecue-grill, or a coffin draped in an American flag. Those sights jarred me a little, because of the timeless feel of everything else; I get Sellars' point, however, and I think he said important things with this half-forgotten oratorio of Handel's.\n\n_Hercules_ plays at the Four Seasons Centre plays until April 30th, with only a few shows left.

        "body": "I remember playing some auditions as part of a \"mock\" audition panel where the singers would get feedback about their audition presentation. I played for a soprano (who’s doing _very well_ for herself lately) who started smart with some Mozart. One of the auditioners then said to her, “Not that it’s _at all_ appropriate, but I’d love to hear the Lodoletta.” Sigh.\n\nIt struck me that opera singers just can't win. No matter how they sound or what they do, someone will have an opinion. Such is life, no doubt; but there's something unique about this trend within the opera world. The habit of giving unsolicited advice to singers has grown into an industry.\n\nI've been privy to plenty of Q&A sessions, coachings, masterclasses, etc., where a group of young potential opera singers learn the difference between good and bad audition behaviour. It starts with making sure you have things like a nice headshot and a clear CV, and takes a rather harsh turn at proper audition attire. By the time you get to what arias or roles are allowed, it's like an abyss of reverse psychology insanity that makes you question your own existence in the universe. It's like a really serious Buzzfeed quiz, \"What Should Your Starting Aria _Really_ Be?\"\n\nAlong the road that is a singer's development, there are checkpoints at which a number of aspiring singers are filtered out of the race. Auditions for undergraduate and graduate schools are two big checkpoints, but the filtering really just comes when young singers are presented with a hurdle. By the time singers are working professionally, they have braved stage fright, foreign language skills, and the struggle for a consistent and workable vocal technique. It seems like the last of these hurdles is learning to \"adapt to the business\", which means \"read people's minds\". And I think that's sort of lame.\n\nLike I said, there's an industry focused on telling singers what they're doing wrong, and it's targeting singers who haven't yet had a chance to really see the industry from within. Even I, a mere pianist, fell for it. Say the experts: your audition dress should be below the knee but not floor-length, with closed-toe pumps that aren't hookery, and with your hair out of your face but not in a ballerina-bun. You should wear contacts, not your glasses. You should start with Mozart or Handel, otherwise the auditioners assume you can't sing. You must be malleable and agreeable with the ideas and wishes of any director and conductor, because you won't get hired again if you're not. Oh, but be unique.\n\nThe result is a bunch of singers who a) all sing the same audition arias, b) are so used to criticism that they're self-flagellating martyrs who can't take a compliment when they hear one. It's a sad thing to see singers who can do truly remarkable things onstage, unwilling to commit to a creative opinion for fear of it being \"wrong\". It's like they're human oxymorons. It's a shame, because they're not _really_ the ones with the fragile egos.\n\nSo, this little mind-game is another stage in the filtering process of potential opera singers, and it works well. But who's left in the race?\n\nThe irony is this: if a singer plays the game, listening to advice from others (assumed to be smarter) about what to sing, how to sing it, and how they should present themselves to the industry, they actually end up ill-equipped for the job. It's an epidemic among young professional singers, this assumption that they know nothing, that they're still an opera outsider, and that all this criticism is what they signed up for.\n\nI suppose singers do indeed sign up for criticism; they _feel_, naked (figuratively, mostly), in front of thousands of people for a living. But it's a chicken-and-egg thing, with these so-called experts offering advice; singers only need to mould themselves into this constricted box of \"acceptable\" because some of the same people who preach about this also work at opera companies and hire singers.\n\nIt's really a shame, because of course there are great directors and conductors (and companies!) who _don't want_ this sort of cookie-cutter singer who does everything \"right\". And I know that professional hierarchy and delegation help get things done. But young singers are getting frightfully used to assuming their opinions are worth the least, which is just tragic when you consider that the singer's job is to pull the whole damn thing off.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I being idealistic? Too tender? Right on the money? Let us know in the comments below!",

Richard Wagner, the \"notoriously bitchy composer\" (David Ward, _The Guardian_), said that Johannes Brahms, composer and owner of classical music's best beard, hated cats. Allegedly, Brahms would sit by a window with a bow-and-arrow-type weapon that [Dvořák](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k) gave him, and shoot arrows at the cats in the street. Once he'd caught a cat, he would reel it in like he was fishing.

Some people who study Brahms have done a [fair job of debunking the rumour;](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1316010/Brahms-expert-puts-cat-killer-claims-to-sleep.html) basically, Wagner was being jealous and making up insane stories about a composer whom he saw as competition. Wagner on Brahms' music: \"the evil only starts when one attempts to compose better than one can.\"\n\nI mean, I get that Brahms was [grumpy](http://www.arthurcolman.com/m_brahms.html), and sort of like the [Eeyore](http://winniethepooh.disney.com/eeyore) of Romantic composers, but I just can't see him perched at a window, sniping cats.

The slogan for _Midsummer_ was, \"Filled with more fairies than St. John's on Pride Day.\" Snort.\n\nBut, of course, some people [had their feelings hurt](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/fairies-billboard-backfires-for-st-john-s-opera-company-1.2618741). Among those complaining is Noah Davis-Power, former president of [St. John's Pride, Inc](http://www.stjohnspride.ca/). \"I think humour is a great tool to make difficult issues more palatable and can be used toward educating people who do have issues with it, but I think that using words like that … when you're putting that on corporate-sized billboards, that takes the humour too far,\" he said.\n\nIn response to everyone who claimed to be offended, Opera on the Avalon Artistic Director Cheryl Hickman responded, \"We apologize,\" she said. \"That wasn't our intent. We don't want to offend anyone.\" After receiving what were probably annoyingly few complaints about the billboard, Opera on the Avalon decided to take it down, and replace it with an ad for OOTA's other show this summer, _La bohème_. Said Cheryl, \"We are an inclusive company and we want everyone to come see our shows and to enjoy these, and if anyone is offended, we want to address that right away.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, I thought it was funny. I never understand people who decide that because _they're_ offended, someone else has to take action. That just doesn't follow. And, I mean, if you keep telling everyone that \"fairy\" is offensive, people will keep taking it as such. There, those are my two shiny pennies.\n\nYou can watch Cheryl's response to the media flurry [here](http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/Canada/NL/ID/2451576024/).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Tough crowd?

        "body": "I went and saw one of my favourite operas last night: [_Hänsel and Gretel_](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/2014-season/), by Engelbert Humperdinck, based on the creepy [Brothers Grimm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm) fairytale. I think it's a show that transports itself well on small and large stages, with small and large orchestras and even pianos. So it was great to see this production by [Metro Youth Opera](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/) in an intimate space, where we could see subtle moments and get to know the characters more quickly. The production is directed by [Alison Wong](https://twitter.com/alleywo); I loved that it made me look twice at the piece, and at the story that I already know well. Alison really found specificity in the German text, which you could see throughout the cast. That text-first starting point is what makes _Hänsel and Gretel_ a compelling story, even without Humperdinck's large orchestra ([or the Met's budget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMuEwhw97RI)).\n\nMetro Youth Opera's aim is to provide professional performance opportunities to young opera singers, and I was impressed with the strength of the cast. [Lyndsay Promane](https://twitter.com/lyndsaypromane) and [Kate Applin](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/artistic-director/) played Hänsel and Gretel, and I thought they were just perfect. Kate was young and unselfconscious, but with real charm and grit; we liked her right away. Lindsay's portrayal of Hänsel was one of the most convincing \"pants roles\" I've ever seen. She was uncanny as a lanky, awkward preteen who's still nice to his sister; all foal-like and disarmingly honest. Kate and Lindsay had real sibling energy together onstage; they made it clear to the audience that Hänsel and Gretel get along and look out for each other, an important thing to establish for the rest of the show. I loved watching them wander through the big city's streets (taking the place of the deep, dark woods), looking at everything and everyone with child-like frankness.\n\nAs the Mother, [Kelsey Vicary](https://twitter.com/kelseyvicary) was terrifying. Vocally, she made a splash with her first shrieking lines; she had tons of power, and the largest voice we had yet heard. She also played \"mom-stressed\" really well. I think one of the scariest feelings as a kid was the awareness that your mom was stressed out, and Kelsey reminded me of that. Her bad-cop parenting was a great foil to [Peter Bass](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/2014-season/), the Father. He appeared as a happy drunk, showing off an easy top register in his first aria. I was glad that Peter showed us a Good Dad, not a drunk or a deadbeat (as is often the case in some productions); his voice has an open and benevolent quality, so it suited his dramatic choices. Together, Kelsey and Peter portrayed an honest married couple; I'd seen their Act I scene many times, but this time I saw the relationship differently.\n\nAs the Witch, [Stephanie Tritchew](https://twitter.com/StephT_mezzo) had huge vocal power and a pretty fierce laugh. Dramatically, I felt her less compelling than her castmates. Her witch-style was part Stepford-wife, part CEO, with a remote control for a wand; I think Stephanie's more calculated, calm Witch made her outbursts really effective, but I suppose I wanted her to be more exaggerated, and unpredictable. It's a tricky role in that the Witch is expected to make a huge splash in a relatively short amount of time onstage. Vocally, Stephanie was fantastically overbearing; I felt her character was comparatively understated. The Witch's child victims were played by ten members of the [Canadian Children's Opera Company](http://www.canadianchildrensopera.com/), who were sufficiently creepy in their vacant, Witch-induced trances.\n\nAs the Sandman, [Karine White](http://www.lfpress.com/2014/01/17/soprano-karine-whites-rapid-rise-includes-dream-role-in-italy) was great. She made her first entrance well before her aria, dressed convincingly as a homeless guy on the street. Karine has a sweet presence to match her voice, and it was a neat effect, sort of like a butterfly coming out of a cocoon. I liked this take on the Sandman; it's always a question for a director about whether or not the Sandman is a benevolent character. This Sandman, a homeless guy coming up to two innocent kids, made the audience felt the initial danger _and_ the goodness underneath a potentially scary exterior.\n\nThe Dew Fairy in this production was one of my favourite takes in the show. [Alexandra Smither](https://twitter.com/smitherisms/lists) sang beautifully, although we saw her before we heard her. As night approached and Hänsel and Gretel were still stranded on the city streets, a lady of the night struts out and takes her post: it's night-time, kids. The Dew Fairy hooker showed up the next morning, holding her shoes, and sang her aria about how great the morning is. Love it.\n\nThe set was minimal, and for the most part, it didn't detract from the drama; our attention was certainly focused on the relationships between the characters onstage. The Witch's scenes were when I felt the visual component was underwhelming. The gingerbread house was alluded to, using rectangular frames to show boxes in which the other kids were trapped by the Witch. I didn't mind any of this, except there were moments where the minimal set design did not fill the needs of the music. Using orchestral interludes, Humperdinck writes magic-music that works like a movie score, and it leaves time for the audience to see a bit of magic.\n\nI'm completely on board with a pared-down _Hänsel and Gretel_, done with piano, but I felt like there could have been musical cuts to those interludes instead; the drama wouldn't have suffered. Music director [Blair Salter](http://blairsalter.com/) did a great job tackling the hefty score at the piano; it's not an easy play. There were musical moments that weren't a good use of the possibilities of the piano. Without a full orchestra, I didn't think the entire overture, for example, added to the show.\n\nDetails aside, I had a great time at Metro Youth Opera's _Hänsel & Gretel._ And I got a little teary, as usual, during their evening prayer. Congrats, guys!\n\n_Hänsel & Gretel_ plays tonight at 7:30pm and tomorrow at 2:30pm; there's still time to catch it, and you should.

        "body": "Ah, Opera Atelier. As far as Canada's opera scene goes, OA is really its own genre. For those unfamiliar, Opera Atelier produces 17th- and 18th- century ballet/opera; the shows are directed and choreographed by co-artistic directors [Marshall Pynkoski](http://www.operaatelier.com/about/creative-team/) and [Jeannette Lajeunesse Zingg](http://www.operaatelier.com/about/creative-team/). I go to Opera Atelier shows because it's a chance for me to see and hear operas from this period, presented by artists who know what they're doing; under conductor [David Fallis](http://barczablog.com/2012/10/12/10-questions-for-david-fallis/), the [Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra](http://www.tafelmusik.org/) is often in the pit, so that's a great start. Last night was opening night of Jean-Baptiste Lully's [_Persée_](http://www.operaatelier.com/season/13-14/persee/), based on the [Greek myth of Perseus](http://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Heroes/Perseus/perseus.html) and his shenanigans with [Medusa](http://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Creatures/Medusa/medusa.html), the lady with snakes for hair. With Zingg's complementary choreography (the artists of the Atelier Ballet were beautiful) and [Gerard Gauci](http://barczablog.com/2011/10/23/10for_gg/)'s truly impressive sets, this production of _Persée_ was great on the eyes as well as the ears.\n\nMarshall Pynkoski uses the device of [Baroque rhetorical gesture](http://www.operaatelier.com/education/opera-lovers/about-the-art/acting/) in his productions. I'm by no means an expert, but the short history is that the gestures were designed to accompany a word or a sentiment in the text, to add to its affect. It's a stylistic choice that has function. Pynkoski works with many of the same singers in each of his productions, and I'm sure it makes for a smoother rehearsal process if more people in the room are starting from the same point of aesthetic.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429838248376/Gorgons-1024x756.jpg)\n<figcaption>l-r: Lawrence Wiliford, Curtis Sullivan, Olivier LaQuerre, Aaron Ferguson. Photo: Bruce Zinger.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n_Persée_ is a piece I didn't know prior to seeing it last night, and it reminded me of my impression of [_Hercules_](/in-review-hercules/) at the COC, in that the show is much more about the ensemble of cast members than simply the title character. The cast was made up of plenty of great Canadian talent, including tenor [Chris Enns](http://www.deanartists.com/vocal/tenor/christopher-enns) in title role. I thought he suited the hero well; his voice is sweet yet decisive, and he made it clear to the audience that Persée is a lover _and_ a fighter. This is Chris' debut with Opera Atelier, but he looked comfy and seasoned up there, including the gestures and postures in which OA veterans find themselves in their sleep. I know Chris, and I got a kick out of his \"dancer double,\" who took Chris' place during the particularly balletic moments of Perseus' battles (I checked the program, and saw there were actually two: [Tyler Gledhill](http://www.thedietrichgroup.com/about/biographies/tyler-gledhill-dance-artist/) and [Brett Van Sickle](http://national.ballet.ca/thecompany/firstsoloists/Brett_van_Sickle/)).\n\nAs Andromède, the princess who loves Persée (he loves her back, don't worry), soprano [Mireille Asselin](http://www.mireilleasselin.com/) was lovely. I always enjoy hearing her sing, and this was a great role for her graceful demeanour. I thought Mireille portrayed Andromède with a balance of royal duty and human vulnerability. She sang with huge amounts of expression, and really showed that this style of opera is much closer to a play, perhaps, than to our modern notion of \"opera\".\n\nSoprano [Peggy Kriha Dye](http://columbusblack.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=320:peggy-kriha-dye-named-general-manager-of-opera-columbus&catid=36:news) was a highlight onstage as Mérope, who also loves Persée (he doesn't love her back, oops). She sang beautifully and tragically, and she immediately had the audience on her side, despite the plot of the opera. I was impressed by her dramatic arc; it's a complicated thing to play the rival of a heroine, without playing a villainess. She broke my heart with her story of unrequited love, and her duet that Mérope sings with Andromède was, as a result, really stunning.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429838327878/Persee-1024x580.jpg)\n<figcaption>Photo by Bruce Zinger.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAs the true villain in the story, Phinée (who loves Andromède, but knows she doesn't love him back), [Vasil Garvanliev](http://imgartists.com/artist/vasil_garvanliev) was brooding and wonderfully jealous. Phinée. His unpredictable, angular style of gesture went perfectly with his dark, mean-sounding singing. Vasil's physical presence onstage was what I really loved; I wished that his voice had projected a bit more, but his intentions were always made clear with his postures.\n\nAs Queen Cassiope, Andromède's mother, soprano [Carla Huhtanen](http://www.carlahuhtanen.com/) was great. She sounded clear and expressive, and was compelling to watch, even when she sang from one of the boxes flanking the stage. I was less impressed with bass-baritone [Olivier LaQuerre](http://www.olivierlaquerre.com/en/Baritone/Home.html) as King Céphée. I had real trouble hearing him, and he seemed a bit stiff rather than stately.\n\nOlivier appeared again as Méduse, the lady Gorgon. Maybe dressing in drag helped him get into character or something, but the voice sounded more free and he sounded like he was having fun. I'll confess that I don't know the real history of this role, but I wasn't expecting a gender-crossing character for Medusa. Pynkoski made a comedy scene out of Medusa and her Gorgon sidekicks (played by Aaron Ferguson and Curtis Sullivan). It was a funny scene, for sure; Olivier, Aaron and Curtis, all dressed in Greek-mythology-drag, talking about how poor Medusa used to be beautiful, but now she's hideous.  I just thought it was a weird scene to choose for the one moment of comedy in the piece; in the previous act, there was lots of build-up about how dangerous it would be for Perseus to go to Medusa's cave (or whatever). But the scene was well done, with beautiful and hilarious ensemble singing by all three Gorgon \"ladies\".\n\nThe supporting cast often did double or triple duty with the many small roles in this show. Tenor [Lawrence Wiliford](http://www.lawrencewiliford.com/) sang Corite and Mercure. I loved him as Mercury, with gorgeous, agile singing that matched his nimble movements around the stage. Bass-baritone [Stephen Hegedus](http://www.stephenhegedus.com/) sang Proténor and Divinité Infernale; his was some of the best singing of the night, and he wins my vote for best costume of the night (by costume designers Dora Rust-D'Eye and Michael Legouffe). Soprano [Meghan Lindsay](http://www.meghanlindsay.com/) was striking both in her role as Nymphe Guerrière and as Vénus. She sang with an effortless, ringing tone, and she had stage presence that showed she was a veteran of the Opera Atelier stage. Baritone [Curtis Sullivan](http://www.deanartists.com/vocal/bass-baritone/curtis-sullivan) was the busiest singer in the cast with four roles: the Grand Prêtre, Cyclope, Sténon and Triton. I've seen Curtis in other shows at Opera Atelier during his long relationship with the company; physically, I understand why Marshall Pynkoski continues to hire Curtis, but I've never been impressed with him vocally.\n\nJeannette Lajeunesse Zingg's choreography was beautiful, and I thought it was the first time that the movements and gestures used by the dancers were in part shared by the singers in the cast. A piece like _Persée_ could be done with dances that are entirely disconnected from the action of the plot; here, I felt they were more complimentary to the affect of the story.\n\nConductor David Fallis beautifully led the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra and Chamber Choir through Lully's score. I'm no Early Music expert, but I thought the Chamber Choir sounded the best I'd ever heard them, and the orchestra really sounded fantastic. I had fun keeping an eye on the duelling continuo sections on opposite ends of the orchestra; at times, each continuo section accompanied a specific character onstage. Neat.\n\nThere are a lot of things about Opera Atelier that frankly aren't my cup of tea. But any objections I have really boil down to style and taste, and perhaps a difference in opinion about the function of opera. I'm someone who looks forward to the continuous evolution of opera as a theatrical genre (not just a musical one), including finding ways of keeping it relevant in the present. I suppose Marshall Pynkoski does the same, by presenting these works from the early years of opera's history, showing us that theatre, movement and opera were never meant to be separate entities.\n\n_Persée_ continues at the Elgin Theatre until May 3rd; for full details and to buy tickets, click [here](http://www.operaatelier.com/season/13-14/persee/).",

So I was really eager to see it for myself.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429837868851/0187-Sara-and-Elisabetta-Credit-Michael-Cooper-1024x681.jpg)\n<figcaption>Allyson McHardy and Sondra Radvanovsky.

And so the curtain rose on [Benoît Dugardyn](http://www.b-dugardyn.be/)'s sets, which clearly and artfully suggested an Elizabethan theatre; the effect was that of a constant stage-within-the-stage, and yet it translated well from scene to scene. It never felt like a \"concept\" that had been stretched too far. Completing Lawless' vision were exquisite costumes by designer Ingeborg Bernerth. It was a grand feast on the eyes, fit for a Queen, really.\n\nThe overture was all I needed to be on board with this production. Lawless staged a sequence that's best described as an operatic version of _Here's Your Life_, showing historical highlights from the life of the Queen. With swift, clean transitions, we saw mini-scenes, of Elizabeth's attendance at the premiere of Shakespeare's _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, of her defeat of the [Spanish Armada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Armada), etc. It was cool, not corny, and it set an organic precedent for the use of the stage-within-stage for the whole show.\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429837927115/0823-centre-Elisabetta-and-Roberto-Devereux-Credit-Michael-Cooper-1024x665.jpg)\n<figcaption>Sondra Radvanovsky, Leonardo Capalbo, Russell Braun. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAs Elizabeth I, Sondra Radvanovsky truly was spectacular. Her voice was beautifully raw, and seemed to have endless force as she scaled huge ranges with fierce energy and complete control. She had a determined resonance in her highest register, shattering the theatre with her gloriously powerful instrument. It sounds trite, maybe, but she reminded me of Maria Callas, that relentless sound that's so exciting and vulnerable. I especially loved her singing in the context of her portrayal of Elizabeth I. Sondra and Stephen Lawless found moments to show the Queen's human frailty, like when she motioned for help climbing a step, and then angrily waved her aides away, as if offended by their offering of their arm. It was wonderfully effective to hear Sondra's powerful voice, showing us that Elizabeth I was weak in body, perhaps, but she was still a strong, smart, terrifying leader. Hers was a thrilling performance for me to see, and I don't think I'll ever forget it.\n\nCanadian mezzo-soprano [Allyson McHardy](http://www.allysonmchardy.com/) sang the role of Sara, the Duchess of Nottingham and the unfortunate rival of the Queen. I really like Allyson's singing, and this was the first time I've heard her in a _bel canto_ role like this. I thought she was a beautiful foil to the fierce, volatile Queen; she was poised and classy, with expressive singing that helped the audience warm to her character. She didn't seem entirely comfortable in her top register, and the role seemed to lie in an irritating spot for most mezzos. But, I thought she paced the role well, finding moments of lightness in the trickier bars. I thought she portrayed Sara as a victim of circumstance, and it just helped make the Queen seem that much more of a wild card.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429838006167/0489-490-Roberto-Devereux-and-Sara-Credit-Michael-Cooper-720x1024.jpg)\n<figcaption>Leonardo Capalbo and Allyson McHardy. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nItalian-American tenor Leonardo Capalbo sang the role of Roberto Devereux; originally it was to be Giuseppe Filianoti, but there was a semi-last-minute change, and Leonardo is singing the first four performances. (Filianoti returns starting on May 10th.) Leonardo sang with a full tone and plenty of defiance in his voice; I found him less polished  in comparison to his co-stars. He was hooking a lot, and the vibrato tended to get wild, and he was often under-pitch. It's a hard thing to share the stage with Sondra Radvanovsky, but I didn't think Leonardo really used his voice to tell his story; I thought he tried to physicalize a lot of his dramatic moments, and it simply translated into some vague singing, and in this kind of music, it's never worth throwing off one's ability to sing.\n\nCornerstone Canadian baritone [Russell Braun](http://www.russellbraun.com/) sang the Duke of Nottingham, the poor guy whose wife, Sara, cheats on him with his friend, Roberto. Russell's warm, benevolent voice gained him sympathy as the Duke, and he had a stoic presence onstage that set us up beautifully for his eventual desire for revenge against all the liars around him. I love hearing Russell sing; I don't think this was a good role for him. He seemed to be working hard in the wrong way, perhaps trying to produce a louder sound, or one that's more like a dramatic baritone. The result was a pressurized sound that made him creep sharp a times, and didn't always cut over the orchestra. Russell is an intensely expressive singer, and I feel that he didn't allow his expression all to come simply from his voice.  It's true that Russell's voice doesn't resonate the same way most _bel canto_ baritones do, but I love his naturally rich, haunting sound. I'd be truly curious to hear what it would sound like if he simplified his performance and let his voice take over.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429838056788/0302-Elisabetta-Credit-Michael-Cooper1-681x1024.jpg)\n<figcaption>Sondra Radvanovsky as Queen Elizabeth I. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSmall roles were well-sung, and I thought there was good attention to detail in their presence onstage, despite having few lines to sing. American bass [Matt Boehler](http://www.mattboehler.com/) was solid as Sir Gualtiero Raleigh, and sufficiently creepy along with tenor [Owen McCausland](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=24213) as Lord Cecil. Owen sounded great in this role; it was small, but it showed him off well. Bass-baritones Gordon Bintner and Neil Craighead were brief but memorable as a Page and Nottingham's servant.\n\nThe COC Orchestra sounded fantastic as usual, this time under the baton of Italian conductor [Corrado Rovaris](http://www.opus3artists.com/artists/corrado-rovaris). I thought there was plenty of that elastic Italian rhythm, and lots of love for the singers' cadenzas. The COC Chorus was also dynamite, including some really cool, almost geometric staging moments in the tiers of the \"Elizabethan Theatre\".\n\nI thought the show was a definite success, despite any of my personal thoughts on the singers. Sondra Radvanovsky is a rare artist, and you should _absolutely_ try and go hear her while she's in town. It's a beautiful production that is packed with fascinating history, the kind that serves up a great story. _Roberto Devereux_ plays until May 21st.

        "body": "I went to [Toronto Operetta Theatre](http://www.torontooperetta.com/)'s _Cousin From Nowhere_, an English translation of Eduard Künneke's [_Das Vetter aus Dingsda_](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Vetter_aus_Dingsda). Whenever I go and hear TOT shows, I always end up hearing some new music that gets stuck in my head, sung by lovely Canadian talent. And _Cousin From Nowhere_, directed by [Guillermo Silva-Marin](http://www.silva-marin.com/) did exactly that. The can't-help-but-smile tunes got to me right away (conducted by [Jurgen Petrenko](http://www.jurgenpetrenko.com/biography.htm)), and the set made me think of old musicals like _My Fair Lady_ and _Carousel_. Kitschy, perhaps; but definitely _charmant_.\n\nThe story is one of lost childhood sweethearts, mistaken identities, and parental control, all that stuff that makes up a sweet story: Julia loves Roderich, staying true to him even though he's been away for seven years, and she's sure he's staying true to her too. When a stranger shows up needing a place to stay, he hears about her long-lost love, and bluffs his way into Julia's arms. Hilarity ensues, until the read Roderich finally does return. I'd be interested in reading the libretto in its original German, since I couldn't shake the feeling that I was listening to a pretty hokey translation of the text. Now, I'll grant a silly plot, but it's a shame when the anachronistic dialogue keeps the singers from creating characters that are relatable.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429836521168/LuciaNyby.jpg)\n<figcaption>Lucia Cesaroni and Michael Nyby. Photo: Emily Ding.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe singing was my favourite part of this show. Soprano [Lucia Cesaroni](https://twitter.com/luciacee) was a total pro in the role of Julia, the lady waiting for her long-lost love, Roderich. Lucia sang with an utterly gorgeous, womanly sound, completely clear and simple. She reminded me of Shirley Jones in _The Music Man_. Her sound was rich and balanced, and she really stood out onstage. Soprano [Charlotte Knight](http://charlotteknightsoprano.com/) played Hanna, Julia's best friend, and she was a perfect fit for this kind of show. She looked like she'd been plucked right out of the 19-aughts, and she had a bell-like voice to go with the pretty picture. Her singing was polished throughout the show, cutting impressively in the ensemble numbers. Together, Charlotte and Lucia were two likeable friends, and the audience was on their side immediately.\n\nTenor [Christopher Mayell](http://www.deanartists.com/vocal/tenor/christopher-mayell) shone as August, the wanderer/charlatan who pretends to be Julia's long-lost love. Chris has something endearing about him when he's onstage, even when his character is basically a con-man. He sang beautifully, with more ease and depth than I've heard before, and it was wonderful to hear him in a lead role with dramatic ups and downs. His character had plenty of the show's hit tunes to sing, and I thought they suited his sweet, vulnerable voice. Chris also had some of my favourite quotable quotes from the English translation, including, \"You little vixen!\" Bravo, friend.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429836584392/GregCharlotte.jpg)\n<figcaption>Charlotte Knight and Gregory Finney. Photo: Emily Ding</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn what was the most anticipated entrance of the evening, baritone [Gregory Finney ](https://twitter.com/gregory_finney)played Julia's the _actual_ long-lost love, Roderich. His was the most organic, mature acting of the night; he did a fantastic job of unpacking a complex character for us in a relatively short amount of time onstage. He sang with a warm, friendly voice that had surprising power. He showed off some slick dancing, too, in an adorable duet with Charlotte. Greg is a thoughtful artist, and we've waxed poetic about drama theory together before (he even [wrote](http://schmopera.com/how-i-acted-my-way-into-an-opera-career/) about it); it was a thrill for me to watch him put it all into practice onstage.\n\nAs Egon, the poor guy who (unrequitedly) loves Julia, tenor [Stefan Fehr](http://www.torontooperetta.com/artists.htm) was great. The role didn't give him much to sing, either because it was a patter-type number or it was a bit low. But he was vocally solid and hilariously tragic as the \"what about me??\" guy after everyone else's happy end. Baritone [Michael Nyby](http://www.michaelnyby.com/Site/Welcome.html) gave a spectacular performance as Julia's uncle, Josef. I thought his was some of the best singing of the night. Michael had enormous power that overflowed from the stage, making me think of Verdi baritones, and making me itch to hear him more in Toronto. As Julia's aunt, [Elizabeth Beeler](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elizabeth-beeler/3b/7b/763) was a shrill, clucking, fainting caricature of a turn-of-last-century, well-do-to lady. I thought she was great for this character, but she didn't seem to fit the vocal aesthetic of everyone else in the cast. She had a pretty darn impressive chest-head voice mix, which gave her lots of volume and room to act. Beeler was the only singer to really use this kind of singing, and while I didn't mind it in principle, she stood out in a way that I don't think was intended.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429836679318/Cousin-from-Nowhere-6137-1024x681.jpg)\n<figcaption>Lucia Cesaroni and Charlotte Knight. Photo: Emily Ding</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nTOT's _Cousin from Nowhere_ left me with pretty tunes in my head, and I got the chance to see some of my fellow Canadian colleagues show off their real skill. The show plays at the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, tonight at 8pm, and closes tomorrow at 2pm. For details and tickets, click [here](http://www.torontooperetta.com/mainprod.htm).",

Nice. \n\nIn Calgary, [Cowtown Opera](http://www.cowtownoperacompany.com/2013/06/12/barber-of-cowtown/#more-1867) is presenting its very own _Barber of Cowtown_, from May 29th-June1st. It's Rossini's _Il barbiere di Siviglia, _in English, \"Cowtown Style\". To top it off, our famed [Christopher Mayell](/two-tenors-youtube-comments/) is singing Count Almaviva.\nOn the Prairies, [Saskatoon Opera](http://www.saskatoonopera.ca/#season) presents Mozart's _The Magic Flute, _opening June 12th. It's conducted by [Christopher Mokrzewski](http://www.christophermokrzewski.com/Home/Christopher_Mokrzewski.html), Resident Conductor at [Calgary Opera](http://www.calgaryopera.com/) and Music Director of [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/), and it features a jackpot cast of Canadian talent. Included are COC Ensemble Studio alumni [Chris Enns](http://barczablog.com/2013/01/25/10forenns/) (Tamino), [Neil Craighead](http://neilcraighead.wordpress.com/) (Sarastro), [Gordon Bintner](http://www.ariamanagement.com/en/nos-artistes/gordon-bintner-w/) (Papageno) and [Ambur Braid](http://amburbraid.com/) (Queen of the Night). [Tickets](http://www.saskatoonopera.ca/#season).\n\nIn Québec, you'll have your pick of great Italian operas. [L'Opéra de Montréal](http://www.operademontreal.com/en/shows/2013-2014-season/turandot) is putting up _Turandot_, opening June 17th, starring Japanese soprano [Hiromi Omura](http://www.hiromiomura.com/) in the title role. At [L'Opéra de Québec](http://www.operadequebec.qc.ca/francais/macbeth.htm), you can see Canadian baritone Gregory Dahl sing the title role in Verdi's _Macbeth_, also opening June 17th.\n\nFinally, here in Toronto, there are the usual good opera pickings. Opening tomorrow, the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/DonQuichotte.aspx) presents Massenet's _Don Quichotte_. Bass (and legend) [Ferruccio Furlanetto](http://www.ferrucciofurlanetto.com/) stars in the title role, and baritone [Quinn Kelsey](http://schmopera.com/talking-with-singers-quinn-kelsey/) will sing the role of Sancho, Quichotte's faithful servant. It plays May 9-24th at the Four Seasons Centre, and I can't wait to see it. [Tickets!](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/DonQuichotte.aspx)\n\nIn June, [Tapestry](https://tapestryopera.com/) presents _Shelter_, a contemporary opera by [Juliet Palmer](http://www.torontoartsfoundation.org/First-Impressions-hidden-pages/Juliet-Palmer), with a libretto by Julie Salverson. With a cast of essential Tapestry talent, (like Keith Klassen and Andrea Ludwig) _Shelter_ plays at the Berkeley Street Theatre from June 12-15th; it's a show I will truly regret not being in town to see. Later in June, [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/shows/pelleas) puts up Debussy's spectacular _P[elléas et Mélisande](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/shows/pelleas)_. Étienne Dupuis and Miriam Khalil sing the title role in this production by Joel Ivany and Julien LeBlanc, which will be performed outdoors in the COC's Max Tanenbaum Courtyard Gardens. _Pelléas_ plays from June 19-25th, and it's [not to be missed](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/shows/pelleas).\n\nI'm sure there's plenty I've left out of my little summary.

He answered my questions about what fun about Banff, and about the mind of Masetto, Mozart's favourite doormat.\n\n### 1) Why did you want to come and sing at Open Space?\n\nThe work [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/) does is very exciting! The chance to work and collaborate with so many incredible artists and leaders in the field of opera is something not to be passed up!\n\n### 2) Why do you think the story of Don Juan is timeless?\n\nAs long as desire exists, I feel we as a culture will be attracted to characters like the Don, even as we warn of the consequences of overindulging those desires. From Uncle John to Jordan Belfort to Walter White, we are drawn to the stories of those who act fully on the spirit of desire, no matter the object.\n\n### 3) What are your own thoughts about the character of Masetto?\n\nMasetto for me represents the \"Regular Guy\". The sort of guy who wears Gap clothes and quotes How I Met Your Mother a lot. It's very easy to play Masetto as wholly envious of the Don's status and power, but I feel he's more memorable when played with a genuine self-acceptance. This isn't to say he's particularly calm! His emotions shift at the drop of a hat, and he lashes out in frustration more than once in the opera.\n\n### 4) What do you most look forward to during your time at The Banff Centre?\n\nOh my...there's so many things I could write! I look forward to having ideas about my character and my voice challenged and expanded, and I always eagerly await that moment in the process when everyone loses themselves in the creative experience; when we as a cast have the music sing us while we sing the music. Does that...make any sense?\n\n### 5) What is the one thing you won’t leave home without?\n\nBreakfast. Guys, breakfast is so awesome. Bacon? Joyful Heavensticks, more like.\n\n### 6) What do you expect to come away from this program having learned/experienced?\n\nI expect to leave with not only a profound understanding of the music I work on and the character I play, but a deeper knowledge of myself and my capabilities as both a singer and a human being. That might sound too lofty, but like any art, opera is a study of humanity, and there's always something to learn about humanity.\n\n<div class=\"p1 intro\">Check back next week to find out who else you can see in _#Uncle John._ For more details, check out the Banff Centre's [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1494928980723400/)!</div>",

        "body": "Massenet's [_Don Quichotte_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/DonQuichotte.aspx) has opened at the Canadian Opera Company, the final in the three spring shows of the 2013/14 season. I'm glad I saw it last, since there was something bittersweet about ending a season with comedy and charm. I'll admit I have a strange personal tendency to get annoyed by everyone's favourite bumbling knight; but perhaps I'm coveting Don Quixote's unwavering pursuit of goodness. Philosophical thoughts quickly vanished when I saw the live horse and mule onstage.\n\nI thought the cast of _Quichotte_ was fantastic across the board. It was, of course, a memorable experience to see legendary bass [Ferruccio Furlanetto](http://www.ferrucciofurlanetto.com/) perform in the title role. He's in his 60s, and the role demands a lot, and he was pretty darn impressive. He really did sing _as Don Quixote_, showing off with risky soft singing and expansive, exaggeratedly grand lines. It was a true display of an entire career's worth of experience and comfort onstage. He had moments of physical impulses that truly were spontaneous, and I have no doubt that if I went to the next show of _Quichotte_, Ferruccio's performance would be noticeably different. He was the embodiment of Don Quixote, all legs and wild hair, and he moved around the stage with surprising agility.  His belaboured sword fights, his stubborn guitar-strumming, his ridiculous lunges at windmill panels, they were all brilliant physical comedy that made Quixote an honest, vulnerable character that everyone could see.\n\nAs Sancho Panza, Quixote's faithful servant, baritone [Quinn Kelsey](http://www.quinnkelsey.com/) nearly broke my heart. Quinn is busy these days with roles like Rigoletto, Germont, Conte de Luna, etc., so it was great to see Quinn in a (partially) comedic role. When he first rode in on that mule with an ear-to-ear grin on his face, I nearly died. Live-animal brownie-points aside, Quinn really did portray Sancho in a way that made us love him. His voice was warm and agile, like a younger man with an old soul; his sound was grounded and frank, a perfect fit for Sancho's role as foil to Quixote. Quinn has a funny habit of singing in straight-tone once in a while, and I think the chatty, comedic elements of this role brought that habit out. It didn't affect his intonation or anything, but Quinn's relaxed, natural voice is so much more desirable. He [spoke to Schmopera](/talking-with-singers-quinn-kelsey/) earlier, talking about his professional relationship with Ferruccio, and how it had some similarities to Sancho's relationship with Quixote. I think I saw some of that between the two singers.\n\nGeorgian mezzo-soprano [Anita Rachvelishvili](http://www.anitarachvelishvili.com/default.html) sang the role of Dulcinée, Quixote's idolized object of his affection. I loved her warm sound that seemed to smoothly wind around her full range. She had huge power, filling the Four Seasons Centre with her enormous sound. Then, she surprised me with her fluid coloratura, focusing her sound so that it became easy to move. The best part of Anita's performance was that she _sang every note_. The dips and dives from low to high registers didn't faze her, and she took the time to make sure we heard her technical prowess. The role of Dulcinée seemed like it demands plenty of a singer, in several bursts over the course of the show. Anita's first appearance was like a more universally-accepted Carmen, happy to be the centre of attention, but no game-player.\n\nDulcinée's four suitors was fantastic. [Sasha Djihanian](https://twitter.com/SashaDjihanian) (Pedro), [Ariana Chris](http://www.robert-gilder.com/ArtistDetail.aspx?artist_id=2305&category_id=1010) (Garcias), [Andrew Haji](http://www.andrewhaji.com/) (Rodriguez) and [Owen McCausland](/tag/owen-mccausland/) (Juan) sounded beautiful together. Their ensemble singing was some of my favourite music of the show, and they all had charming moments of interaction with Dulcinée. Andrew's voice rang easily through the hall, and Owen sang with an ever-growing sound that's exciting to hear. Ariana and Sasha were both great in their pants roles; Sasha has a surprising knack for playing male characters, and her Pedro was the cutest thing I ever did see.\n\nThe COC Chorus was great as usual, staying crisp in what seemed like tricky patter and wordy chorus parts. Canadian tenor [Michel Corbeil](http://www.micartists.com/micbio_MC.htm) lead the team of bandits that Quixote encounters, and he showed off some great acting chops. Individual members of the chorus were featured as well, in small lines, often spoken.\n\nI thought this production, by director [Linda Brovsky](http://www.robert-gilder.com/ArtistDetail.aspx?artist_id=2366&category_id=1019&location_id=3001), was an appropriate mix of alluding to the significance of the story of Don Quixote, and staying present in the action. At times, I struggled to figure out what I was supposed to be looking at. In the first scene, the chorus blended visually with the cast so much that I wouldn't have known to follow the four suitors if I didn't already know three of them.\n\nThe sets and costumes, by [Donald Eastman](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/donald-eastman/44/816/675) and [Christina Poddubiuk](http://www.catalysttcm.com/christinapoddubiuk.html), worked well with each other. The sets consisted of oversized stacks of books and writing quills, nodding to the historicity of the story of Don Quixote. By contrast, the costumes were all time-specific, setting it in the 16th century, when the Cervantes wrote the [original novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote). I thought the combination made for a beautiful picture that allowed for suspended disbelief; at times, though, the sets didn't quite cut it for the drama. In the scene when Quixote attacks a windmill, the surrounding sets (oversize feather pens) were too frail to really stand for the chaotic attack that the story recounts. It was sort of anticlimactic.\n\nThe music was fantastic from the COC Orchestra, under the baton of the COC's Music Director, [Johannes Debus](http://www.coc.ca/aboutthecoc/companymembers/Orchestra/JohannesDebus.aspx). The music was a lush mix of Massenet's usual soaring phrases and Spanish party music. In fact, five fantastic dancers were featured throughout the show, and I thought it was a really organic use of dance in modern(ish) opera.\n\nI left _Don Quichotte_ with a tug at my heartstrings, and you should really make the time to go and see this production. It's a treat to see a major artist like Ferruccio Furlanetto on the Four Seasons Centre stage, and the piece itself is a gem that's done infrequently. It runs until May 24th; for tickets and more info, click [here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/DonQuichotte.aspx).",

Once we get rolling, we'll plant cameras in rehearsals, and show you our favourite photos, tweets, and grizzly bear sightings of the day.\n\nOh, and the camera _will be rolling_ when we take [Topher](http://www.christophermokrzewski.com/Home/Christopher_Mokrzewski.html) on a nature walk.\n\nSounds fun, right? Stay tuned, because it'll kick off soon!\n\nAnd a grizzly-bear count, because it's Banff.",

        "body": "I'm a pianist who works with opera singers. It's awesome, and I love it, and I can't stop doing it. But in all honesty, I must address some gross habits of disrespect and neglect with which pianists often have to deal. Enough is enough.\n\nPianists, I'm not talking about how it's annoying when you get single-sided photocopies from a singer, or a voice teacher keeps you late in a lesson because they don't check their watch. I'm talking about shockingly common occurrences that just aren't professionally cool. I bet some of this sounds familiar:\n\nYou schedule a coaching and the singer doesn't show up. You play for an audition, and the singer didn't bring any cash. You play at Some Company's event, and you're so not on anyone's radar that no one at the event knows where your cheque is. For weeks. You play at a Rich Person's party, and the host was just too busy to arrange your payment (and that Rich Person's party, I promise, has plates of _hors d'oeuvres_ that are more expensive than you). All of this means you don't get paid on time, or at all.\n\nBut it's a bigger problem than petty freelance nuisances. Contracts, for pianists, can resemble less a clearly outlined document than an amorphous blob of loopholes and vagueries. You decide to go and work on a show, say. When you get there, you're surprised with several extra \"performance opportunities\". You're now going to be the recital/masterclass/audition bitch, and you're probably going to sight-read all the music involved.\n\nTo be fair, most working pianists are more than capable of taking on the extra work; but the point is, it's not what you agreed to do. It's not what you're being paid to do. I ask you: _in what other industry_ would a company be allowed to change anything on your contract without consent, and without an offer to compensate you for the extra time? Unbelievable.\n\nI suppose when we're talking about no-show coachings or \"I forgot my chequebook\" crap, you could argue that they're examples of the usual plight of the freelancer. But how can pianists protect themselves from having their income decimated by others' disorganization? Perhaps a solution is to insist that singers send a deposit in advance for their coachings, and refuse to play that audition or that Rich Person's party until you get paid first. But here's the thing: no clients will do that. It's unfortunately true that if I suddenly started charging for coachings that are no-shows or same-day cancellations, I'd quickly develop a reputation of being a miserly, money-hungry coach who's not interested in making music. I also just won't see the money, because any singer who no-shows without explanation is also going to go AWOL when you ask for compensation. I could demand that Some Company or Rich Person pay me for his party before my hands touch the piano; I can demand all I want, but if they choose not to pay in advance, I'm out of luck. I either refuse to play the gig (and lose the fee), or I slink over to the piano and take my place as the grossly overqualified \"help\".\n\nI’m willing to give the benefit of the doubt to some of this Companies and People, often because they’re unfamiliar with how the pianist’s business is ideally run. But more commonly, your superiors come from an artistic background themselves. This means that they should know the value of a pianist. (I'll give them a hint: _it's the same value as everyone else that helps put that opera together_.) So if these people make a mockery of your schedule and make oversights that cost you money, they're either doing it because they forgot to do a better job, or they don't care. Both are absolutely, utterly unacceptable.\n\nAnd why do pianists put up with it? Because we can't afford not to. Sure, we're thanked profusely (even publicly!) for our extra work. When we save the day by sight-reading like a monster for a masterclass, we're momentarily everyone's hero. But that's not good enough. Again, _in no other industry_ would you dream of asking a trained professional to do work that wasn't on their contract, for which you have no intent of paying them.\n\nSo, pianists, I implore you: stop it. Stop playing the band-aid. Stop running in to save the day because other people are disorganized. Don't play that gig until you're paid (like most other services!). I know I just said that pianists can't be too picky with their gigs. But en masse, we could really make a point. Could you _imagine_ if we stuck to the wording of our contract the way other independent contractors do? If we boycotted that forgetful singer's audition? If we refused to schedule a coaching until we're paid upfront?\n\nI'm being slightly sensationalist in my tone, sure. But only because we have to be our own union. We cannot have a fluctuating income because so many of our clients are flakey by nature (yes, I'll stereotype artists for a second). Fellow pianists, you know as well as I do that if we were all to go on strike, the opera industry would freak out.\n\nIf you're like me, you love this industry despite all of the above. I know you do. But remember that you're more than valuable, pianists. _You're vital_. Remind your colleagues of that with the only leverage you have: your ten fingers.",

        "body": "_Der Rosenkavalier_ opened at [Glyndebourne](http://glyndebourne.com/production/der-rosenkavalier) on May 17th, and the opening night reviews ticked off some opera fans. Ordinarily, one would be happy that a bunch of critics can't stop talking about Irish mezzo [Tara Erraught](http://imgartists.com/artist/tara_erraught)'s performance of Octavian. But in this case, it's because the critics apparently couldn't stop from being mean. Not critical. Mean. They picked on Tara's appearance, because apparently her singing wasn't bad enough to pick on. They called her \"dumpy\", \"stocky\", and \"unsightly and unappealing.\" Why? Because they're mean.\nLike this garbage about Tara's performance from _The Telegraph_'s opera critic [Rupert Christiansen](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalconcertreviews/10839018/Glyndebourne-2014-Der-Rosenkavalier-review.html): \"Is [the director] simply trying to make the best of her intractable physique or is he trying to say something about the social-sexual dynamic?\" Why, Rupert? Do you think it's a groundbreaking social statement to say that an \"average looking\" guy can score a pretty girl? I hope not, Rupert, for your sake.\n\nOr from [Michael Church](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/reviews/der-rosenkavalier-glyndebourne-opera-review-perversely-cast-9395750.html) at _The Independent_: \"Since this Octavian (Tara Erraught) has the demeanour of a scullery-maid, and since the two seem so alike in age, you’d say it was a torrid lesbian affair.\" What the...? Why, Michael? Because you've seen stereotypical lesbian relationships on TV, where one of the women is definitely \"the man\"?\n\nThe few mentions of Tara's singing were all positive, even from snobby Rupie Christiansen: \"There is no doubt of the talent of this young Irish mezzo, based in Germany, who sings with vibrant assurance and proves herself a spirited comedian.\" Cool. Great. Except he went on to talk about her being \"dumpy of stature\".\n\nTo quote the late and very great (and a bit rotund in his later years) Christopher Hitchens: What is this babble?\n\nIt would be one thing to have the old fight about how much of opera is about hearing versus seeing. But this is not that fight. This new production of _Der Rosenkavalier_, directed by [Richard Jones](http://www.richardjonesdirector.co.uk/), looks pretty active onstage for the whole cast. I see [production photos](http://glyndebourne.com/production/der-rosenkavalier) of Tara Erraught, and, like, she's doing stuff. Standing, kneeling, pulling a Cherubino, etc. This is not a fight about overweight or unattractive people onstage _costing the audience their enjoyment of an opera_. Yes, opera is a form of theatre, and what you hear and see are both vital. But this is not the same as the obese singers of past decades parking and barking and being boring because they're not mobile. This is not Tristan and Isolde, unable to kiss for the expanses of their respective bellies. This is a woman who got onstage to sing an incredibly difficult role in a high-stakes environment, at the mercy of critics who feel the need to pad their reviews with some _tsk-tsks_.\n\nAnd it really is as simple as that. Opera is complicated enough without people _who don't do it_ writing insults about them. British mezzo (and my new singer crush) [Alice Coote](/talking-with-singers-alice-coote-mezzo-soprano/) wrote an [open letter to opera critics](http://slippedisc.com/2014/05/alice-coote-an-open-letter-to-opera-critics/), and it's published on [Slipped Disc](http://slippedisc.com/2014/05/singers-in-uproar-at-critical-body-insults-at-glyndebourne/). she's dealt with her share of hurtful reviews in the past, and I hope her letter hit little Rupie and Mikey right in the feels.\n\n*Update: Rupert Christiansen [published his defence](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/10844053/I-stand-by-every-word.html) after all the critic-criticisms came rolling in. He disagrees with Alice's letter, stating \"I am a critic, not a cheerleader. Alice Coote once said to me: “Tell us the truth, no matter how hard!” This is all that I have ever aspired to do.\" In my humble, blogger's opinion, this isn't about truth. It's about how unhelpful comments about Tara's appearance don't logically follow comments about how she's a great comedian. It's still just mean.\n\nGot a comment? I'm sure you do!",

        "body": "I kind of dread being asked what I do. That’s an awful thing to say, given what an interesting and unique job I have, but it’s true. At a non-music party [NMP, for your future reference!] or in a cab, the conversation usually starts something like this:\n“So you’re travelling a lot for work – what’s your job?”\n\n“I’m a singer!”\n\n“Oh, what kind of singer?”\n\n“Classical!”\n\n“Wow!” – and then, shortly afterwards, almost inevitably – “How amazing to be following your passion!”\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429832260631/passion-of-the-cellist1.jpg)\n<figcaption>What Passion Definitely Looks Like For Real, You Guys.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI always agree, because it _is_ amazing. And also because, often, I’d just rather move on to other topics. Partly, this is because I'm trying to break myself of the unpleasant habit of complaining about what I do in order to make it seem less glamourous (and _may I just_ take a moment to say to those in doubt: I haven’t yet caught a whiff of glamour… do let me know if you can point me in its direction). The other reason is that the word “passion” unsettles to me. My knee-jerk reaction is to picture that cellist in the arthritis commercial who is just _so fulfilled_ to be Making Music in her sunlit studio (or on a grassy hilltop or wherever) that all her cares (though, besides early-onset arthritis, she doesn’t have any real cares, because she is a Free Spirit) just ebb away at the touch of bow to string. And I want to scream “It’s Not Like That, OK?!”\n\nI realize I probably sound like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vvBAONkYwI) [spoiler alert, this is a link to Britney Spears singing about how hard it is to be famous – _and also looking into a hand-mirror while sitting in front of a big mirror, at 1:33_ ]. So let me be clear: I really _do_ feel lucky – incredibly lucky – to be living the life of a professional artist. And it’s unfair of me to assume that when people say I’m “following my passion” that they mean I’m spending my life dancing in the rain, whereas other people have to _work_ for a living. It doesn’t give people enough credit. It’s a reaction to the media-supported artistic ideal I was (probably?) rather stumblingly trying to allude to in [this](http://schmopera.com/two-tenors-youtube-comments/) drunken masterpiece of op-ed – that, for people like the YouTube-comment genius who values the _un_trained child singer higher because of “superior natural ability,” to be an artist is just to spill out art. And if you can get paid for that, you’re set!\n\nIt irks me, whenever I see a variant of this Wind-In-The-Hair Cellist Experiencing Passion (Am I the only person who has such a specific image of this particular trope?), that this imaginary art-person seems perfectly fulfilled in the moment just to participate in the Holy Sacrament of Passion. We’re getting into dangerous territory here, and perhaps I'm outing myself as a sour type who can't feel feelings, but I have to admit – that does not speak to my experience of being a professional singer.\n\nThis is NOT to say that I don’t experience these moments of euphoric transport from time to time. It’s happening more, actually, as I move toward being able to fully sideline that [nasty gremlin inside my head](http://schmopera.com/on-the-ego/) during performance. Even in the past month there have been multiple times when, in performance, I’ve felt myself slip into that magic space where it seemed like I was really saying something, and people were really listening, and that was all that mattered. It doesn’t happen as often as you might think, and it feels great.\n\nBut is that feeling what the “passion” I’m following is all about? Is that what makes people get into this racket, and _stay in_?\n\nIn this [woefully simplistic article](http://elitedaily.com/money/entrepreneurship/10-things-that-truly-passionate-people-do-differently/?fb_action_ids=10101290683781257) on “Truly Passionate People” (which follows the unfortunate current trend of breaking down into 10 or fewer instructive bullet points the defining characteristics of “Happy People”, “The Romantically Fulfilled” and other enviable categories of unicorn) the author states that the eponymous Pashies [my abbreviation!] – In addition to living “happier and better lives than the average individual” and “always think[ing] positively about the future” – “have a clear understanding of what [their] purpose in life is.” (It also says they get up early in the morning, so that counts me out.)\n\nThere's a settled, contented tone in these proclamations that doesn't fit with my experience of being passionate about something. What does it really _mean_ to be passionate, and what kind of place can it/should it take in the life of a professional artist? For someone like me, any creation process or performance is a mixed experience. Even if I’m pleased at the end, and can manage to feel proud of what I’ve done, the action itself is inevitably full of the intense focus and _effort_ required to not only be honest and be beautiful, but to make it seem like it is all just pouring out of me of its own accord. Because ultimately the point of it all is for other people to have the experience of being fulfilled by the art, _not for me to_. And all this is characterized by a fundamental dissatisfaction with my work – something I am slowing learning to balance, by allowing more room to feel accomplishment – which is what drives me to improve.\n\nIs that what passion is? The push to always try harder even when it’s rough and you _don’t_ feel satisfied and it seems like you’ll never reach your goal because the goal is constantly moving just out of your reach?\n\nThe author of the aforementioned _Idiot’s Guide to Pashies_ [my title!] says “[passions] make us feel that we’re on the right path in life and give us hope for a happy and exciting future.”\n\nIt’s hard to argue with such a truism… but I will anyways. What bothers me about this kind of glib journalism is the same perceived preconception that makes me not want to talk about what I do with strangers. I often sense, underlying in such statements, a muddy equating of “passion” with that elusive and nebulous old beast “happiness.” Happiness being the goal, passion being the road to it. Follow your passion, and it will lead you to happiness. Then you’ll just settle in there at the Happy Homestead and write articles about the Ten Things I Do Differently.\n\nAgain, I know this is unfair and reductionist, and that most people probably see passion closer to how I see it – as a driving force, a compulsion even, rather than as a direct line to happiness. What’s held in common is that passion gives purpose. What’s different – and I don’t think this is just semantics – is the implication that passion = meaning in life = happiness (= I feel happy! Yay! The End).\n\nThe truth (for me, anyways… every paragraph printed here should be prefaced by the disclaimer, “The views expressed below are only those of one disgruntled tenor”) is that, although following my passion is responsible for some of the most exciting and rewarding moments of my life, it is also responsible for _far more_ tongue-biting-Why-Gawd-Why-screaming-innocent-object-punching frustration. This is because, despite what you might hear on The Voice, “passion” is not something that _makes you feel good_. And that is precisely why it’s a such a force. To have passion in your life is to have the experience of seeing a problem or an incompleteness and not being able to NOT deal with it. It can pull you out of bed in the morning or keep you up at night because you feel like you’ll go insane if you can’t address all the things that are left undone. Passion is the feeling of being *unfulfilled*, and trying to solve that.\n\nIn my case, as someone who interprets existing artistic creations, as well as producing my own, the passion my career is built around is the desire to communicate to other people something beautiful that is also representative of something true. It’s kind of a mouthful to try to talk about it [witness: previous \"sentence\"], and it’s certainly a handful to try to do it, knowing it can never be perfect. It enrages me and it opens me up every single day to feeling like I’ll never be good enough. It _isn't_ that stereotypically cathartic process that we know from so many movies about artists (the concept of which, in my opinion, confuses _making_ art with what it's like to _experience_ great art) but, though I might say otherwise when I’m in the muck of it, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Having a job that relates to one of my passions _does_ give me a reason to get up in the morning, and it does give my life direction, and the more people from different walks of life I meet, the more I realize how incredible and rare that is. And, bonus: I’m never bored!\n\nDoes this ring true to the way you experience passion? Am I just too sensitive and rarefied (I already know the answer to this)? Should I just shut up and play my cello? Let me know in the comments section!",

        "body": "### Do you like flying?\n\nI guess it depends on the length of the flight, but overall, yes, I do like flying. If I get a seat by the window, I won’t hesitate to look out and watch the ground disappear as the plane takes off. I still think clouds up close are super cool, and that they look like cotton candy. A little bit of turbulence can be fun - just enough so you feel like you’re on a mini roller coaster ride.\n### What appealed to you about _Airline Icarus_?\n\nI find the _Airline Icarus_ characters and their personal psycho-dramas very interesting. The opera gives the audience snapshots of the lives of various individuals - the Advertising Executive (my character), the Business Man, the Scholar, and the Flight Attendant. Each character is imploding through their own magnified insecurities; the rise and fall of their emotions are reflected in the \"smoothness\" or \"turbulence\" of the aircraft's flight. I feel that the characters are believable human beings that the audience can relate to, and they form the core of the opera.\n### What can you tell us about your character in _Airline Icarus_?\n\nI sing the role of the Advertising Executive - a career-oriented woman who has attained a high level of success. Despite her achievements, she’s now reached a point in her life where she despises her job, and worries about growing old and gaining weight – which has manifested itself into an eating disorder. Ultimately, she worries about ending up alone in life, and envies the happiness that her sister has found in having a family. It’s fascinating to be immersed in such a complex character. I'm constantly discovering new things about the Ad Exec through each rehearsal, and most likely will continue to do so throughout the run.\n### You sing a lot of both Early music and new music. What do you find in common with these two “poles” of the operatic repertoire?\n\nI think most, if not all of us, have ears that are more attuned to the music of the classical and romantic periods. The \"bookend\" eras of Early Music and New Music offer unexpected twists and surprises in melody and harmony, which can be more challenging for both the performer and the listener. However, these unique \"surprises\" are also what can captivate us mentally and emotionally. Personally, I've grown to love singing Early and New Music because of the challenges the repertoire affords me.\n### What’s it like to work with a living composer on new music?\n\nIt’s an incredibly rewarding experience. Working with Brian Current on _Airline Icarus_ has been very inspiring. Since he’s conducting his own work as well, I feel like all of us in the cast are benefiting directly from the creator. It pushes us, in a good way, to live up to his musical vision. Brian has been generous in sharing his ideas, but has also been open and co-operative with making changes to support the creative team and the cast. I feel that the production is blossoming in a unique way, and it's an example of collaborative effort at its best.\n### How do you think _Airline Icarus_ adds to today’s new operatic repertoire? What does it say about people/society/technology today?\n\nI think _Airline Icarus_ is a significant and vital addition to today’s new operatic repertoire. The opera’s narrative makes an important statement about the rise and fall of human beings through the progression of technology. Society always strives for the next revolutionary technological development. People are quick to get their hands on the latest device, easily equating self-worth to the most “high-end” electronic available. We can lose ourselves in a sea of Twitter posts and selfies. Through the Greek mythological character of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun, the opera’s underlying message is to take heed of our own hubris, and to reflect on the ruin that comes with the excess of pride and ambition.\n<div class=\"intro\">_Airline Icarus_ runs from June 3rd-8th, at Ada Slaight Hall, Daniels Spectrum, 585 Dundas St. E. It's conducted by composer Brian Current, and Vania Chan joins a cast that's full of Canadian talent like Krisztina Szabó, Geoffrey Sirett, Alexander Dobson and Jennifer Taverner.

That Neanderthal-like rant about how opera is full of \"leftist\" snobs that eat brie and say words like \"lilt\"? I mean, if you want to hear some homophobic, proudly ignorant, reverse-elitist babble, [have a listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcmMZIX0pZo&feature=kp). Now, I'm clearly an advocate of keeping opera accessible to the general public. But Glenn Beck's level of stupidity (staged or not) is gross enough that I proclaim him a lost cause; it's a loss over which I'm not losing any sleep.\n\nBut one thing about that rant stayed with me after my heart rate slowed back down: it was the bit about the word \"lilt\". Since we, as opera lovers, are unofficially in the business of keeping opera accessible to the general public (except Glenn Beck; I won't lose sleep over his absence in the theatre), we have to be extra sensitive to anything that smells \"elitist\". Things like what to wear to the opera (jeans are legal!), the price range of the tickets, and whether or not to translate Italian operas into English are all up for debate. Does this include our vocabulary too?\n\nIn the rehearsal room, artists have a lifetime of too many books and too many foreign languages at their disposal when it comes to professional vocabulary. It's pretty beautiful. We say things like \"the _denouement_ of that phrase could be a bit more _innig,_\" or \"starting at the _alla breve_, the music cries out for _Sturm und Drang_, wouldn't you say?\" We say words like \"crystalline\" and \"glorious\" and \"exquisite\" and \"facile\" and \"organic\". I love it. Sometimes the best word to describe that tune really is \"rapturous\". And with these juicy words comes plenty of communication and understanding within the creative process.\n\nI'm not insinuating that non-artists can only handle monosyllabic adjectives. We're absolutely not the sole proprietors of flowery language. But does verbosity add to the sticky argument over elitism? Does it degrade opera to say things like \"_Don Giovanni_ is a sexy, sexy opera\" or, \"Joyce DiDonato is a freaking rock star?\" I mean, the statements are true, albeit incomplete. But do the potential new audience members really _need_ to know anything more about an opera in order to get their bums in seats? Does a review hold more weight if it's written, well, snobbishly?\n\nAlbert Einstein supposedly said something like, \"If you can't explain something simply, then you don't understand it well enough.\" Does this apply to opera? Readers, what do you think?",

        "body": "Don Juan. Love him or hate him, he's been around for at least 400 years. Why? Because he's a juicy character with which we've all got something in common. Everyone struggles with moderation in their lives; food, drink, and sex have forever played a role in our personal conflicts with desire and will-power. If you're mysteriously immune to the temptations of the Big Three, you're bound to be lured by something else. Or, you're a robot.\n\nThe first written account of the Don Juan story is thought to be the [play](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_burlador_de_Sevilla_y_convidado_de_piedra) by Tirso de Molina, written in 1630 and set in the 14th century. It's entitled _El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra_ (_The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest_). We meet the servant, Catalinón, who exasperatedly cleans up the messes left by his master, Don Juan. Over the course of the play, Don Juan manages to enrage one Doña Ana and her father, a vengeful Tisbea, and even a young bride-to-be, Aminta, and her groom, Batricio. To top it off, Doña Ana's father gets unjustly killed by Don Juan, and comes back in time to haunt the Don over dinner and drag him off to hell. Sound familiar? You can give it a [read for yourself](http://barons.smhall.org/facultyweb/w2179/stm28395-01/Playboy_of_Seville.pdf).\n\nThe story of course ruffled some puritan feathers, but such is the tale of all the best art. Molière played the role of Sganarelle, the servant, in [his play](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_Juan), _Dom Juan ou le Festin de pierre_ in 1660\\. Tisbea becomes Elvire, and the central action of the plot surrounds Don Juan's lies to the poor woman, and her brothers who attempt to avenge her honour. Don Juan still kills a Commandant, who comes back for ghostly dinner and serves up justice.\n\nItalian composer Giuseppe Gazzaniga beat Mozart and da Ponte by a few months in the opera department, with his _[Don Giovanni Tenorio o sia Il convitato di pietra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Giovanni_Tenorio) _(_Don Giovanni Tenorio, or The Stone Guest_), which premiered in February of 1787\\. The work was shorter than Mozart's, appearing as part of a double bill, but Lorenzo da Ponte certainly knew of Gazzaniga's _Giovanni_. (Gazzaniga's _Don Giovanni_ always makes me think of poor Leoncavallo's _La bohème._)\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429819389284/moz_don.jpg)\n<figcaption>The first page of Don Giovanni, in Mozart's hand.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAfter Mozart and da Ponte's _Don Giovanni_ opened in 1787, the piece fuelled more and more faces of Don Juan. [E.T.A. Hoffmann](http://shirtysleeves.blogspot.ca/2007/06/translation-of-don-juan-by-e-t-hoffmann.html) wrote his 1813 novella, _Don Juan: A fantastical event that befell a music enthusiast on his travels, _in which the protagonist attends a performance of the opera, and is enamoured with the spectacle, as well as with the sight of the singer playing Donna Anna. [Lord Byron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan_(Byron)), between 1819 and 1824, wrote 16 poems (and one unfinished) on the story of Don Juan, calling it \"Epic satire\". The critics ranted about immoral content, but the readers devoured the poems. Don Juan even made it into Russian literature, in the form of [Alexander Pushkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stone_Guest_(play))'s 1830 play _The Stone Guest._\n\nEven the moral questions raised by the story of _Don Juan_ are timeless. Some of my absolute Don Juan philosophizing is by [Søren Kierkegaard](http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Either/Or), in his _Either/Or_. Using the pseudonyms \"A\" and \"B\" (or The Judge), Kierkegaard presents two polar ways of life, the pursuit of pleasure and the pursuit of ethics. The question is simple enough: how should we live? Kierkegaard finds a perfect example of the aesthete in the character of Don Juan, who is insatiable in his desire for _more women_. This insatiate cannot enjoy the woman he has now, because he already desires the next. In line with the oldest prescription in the book, the answer to the question, \"How should we live?\" is a combination of seeking pleasure and consideration for others. Moderation, and all that.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429819454256/Cartel-de-Don-Juan-Tenorio-934x1024.jpg)\n<figcaption>Salvador Dalí's Cartel de Don Juan Tenorio, 1949.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nMozart and da Ponte's _Don Giovanni_ has seen plenty of evolution since its premiere in Prague on October 29, 1787, perhaps hitting an unnecessarily tacky wall with Kasper Holten's filmed version, _[Juan](http://juanfilm.dk/eng/index.php?page=historien)_. (I mean, either make a movie about [Don Juan with Johnny Depp](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112883/) in it or leave the opera on the stage, am I right? Some purist veins, have I.) But one large digression from its \"original state\" is the size of voice. Opera singers who are considered fit for today's performances of _Giovanni_ would have sounded Wagnerian by comparison. We know the cast included some singers who were pretty darn young, by today's standards. Luigi Bassi, who sang the first Don Giovanni, was only 24 at the opera's premiere. The Donna Anna was 24-year-old Teresa Saporiti, who had a pretty short vocal career, but apparently was at least a knockout to look at.\n\nAnd they _improvised_. _Don Giovanni_ was supposed to premiere on October 14th, 1787, but the singers added to several delays, according to letters fro<span style=\"color: #333333;\">m Mozart: \"Everything dawdles along here because the singers, who are lazy, refuse to rehearse on opera days and the manager, who is anxious and timid, will not force them.\" The so-called opera days were one out of every three, which left a horrifyingly short rehearsal period for a piece like _Giovanni_. It's an educated assumption (and the late [<span style=\"color: #333333;\">Charles Mackerras</span>](http://www.opera.co.uk/view-review.php?reviewID=46) agrees with me) that the opera was not learned with the level of detail that we consider acceptable today. Luigi Bassi, after a later performance of _Don Giovanni_ in Dresden, spoke about keeping the show fresh for its audience: \"[T</span>he supper scene] lacked the liveliness, the freedom, that the great master wanted in this scene. [In Prague] we didn’t sing this scene the same way two evenings running. Without keeping strict time, we cracked jokes—new ones every night—and just kept a careful eye on the orchestra. Everything was virtually spoken, as if we were improvising, as that is what Mozart wanted.\" Consider that Mozart arrived in Prague on October 4th, to begin rehearsals for _Don Giovanni_, with huge chunks of the opera still left to write. He hadn't touched the overture, Zerlina and Masetto's entrance, the entire graveyard scene or the finale. It is said that Mozart was still scribbling out orchestral parts to the overture the night of the premiere, delaying downbeat by almost an hour. Ballsy. Also, less control-freaky.\n\nSo, we've got decidedly young voices onstage, and both the music and libretto were not set in stone (pardon the vague pun). To top it off, the theatre that housed the premiere was teeny tiny. The Estates Theatre in Prague held around 800 seats, making most desirable opera houses of today look obese. Not only was it small, but ill-lit, and it had acoustics that were bad enough to warrant selling copies of da Ponte's libretto for the audience members who cared enough to follow along. Compare this evening at the opera to, say, Ferruccio Furlanetto and Carol Vaness hollering out Mozart at the [Met in 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKfeuF_uvk8), and it's a real apples-to-oranges situation.\n\nAnd so, we finally come to the newest permutation of the Don Juan tale, in the form of [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/)'s [_#UncleJohn_](https://www.facebook.com/events/1494928980723400/), set to have its first performance at the [Cave and Basin National Historic Site](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/ab/caveandbasin/activ/calendrier-events.aspx#August) in Banff, Alberta. There's nothing conventional about it. Da Ponte's Italian has been morphed into director and librettist [Joel Ivany](https://twitter.com/joelivany)'s English adaptation, and Mozart's music inevitably takes on a new dramatic intent. Purists will stay ruffled if they so desire, but what's timeless about the Don Juan story will never be absent, no matter how it's packaged. I'm thrilled to join a team of creative folks who will join the line of imaginations that keep posing these eternally relevant questions. How _should _we live, indeed?\n\nStay posted at Schmopera to get some answers from [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/), [The Banff Centre](http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=1457), the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/), and of course, the [_#UncleJohn_ cast](http://schmopera.com/?s=%23UncleJohn).",

At the SYI, the participants bring their existing interests and skills, and refine them with the help of professionals in the operatic industry. They get masterclasses in vocal technique with voice instructors Mark Daboll and Karine St. Pierre, and in dramatic technique with dramaturge and director Markus Howard. They'll take a dramatic workshop with opera and theatre director Liza Balkan. Set designer Camellia Koo will teach them the ins and outs of production design, and Casey Hudecki will give a workshop in stage combat (how fun is that?). At the end of the program, music director Kyra Millan and director Lianne Seykora will lead a performance of operatic proportions for the participants' family and friends. For more details, check out the SYI's [complete faculty list and daily schedule](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/YoungAdults/SummerYouthIntensive/SYIPrograms.aspx).\nThis year, the SYI will be performing _Brundibár_, written in 1938 by Czech composer Hans Krása. The piece has a [fascinating history](http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/places/theresienstadt/brundibar/): it was first performed in 1943 by children who had been interred at Terezín concentration camp during the Holocaust. This summer's SYI participants will perform the English adaptation of _Brudibár_ by American writer Tony Kushner (_Angels in America_, _Lincoln_).\n\nI had the opportunity to work with the Summer Youth Intensive program in the summer of 2013, and it really is a special chance for young people, already catching the opera and theatre bugs, to get even more inspired with the help of the fantastic faculty and resources provided by the Canadian Opera Company. This year the program has expanded to two weeks (July 7-12th and July 14-19th), and participants can attend one or both sessions. The application deadline is June 22nd, so [click here](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/YoungAdults/SummerYouthIntensive.aspx) to find out more details. I still get warm fuzzies thinking about the sense of accomplishment and _fun_ to be had at the Summer Youth Intensive program. Tell the young artists in your life!\n\nNeed more convincing?  I had the opportunity to chat about the program with Katherine Semcesen, Associate Director, Education and Outreach at the Canadian Opera Company:\n\n### What is the SYI?\n\nSummer Youth Intensive provides young people in Grades 9 to 12 an opportunity to develop their performing arts or visual design skills, and gain access to artists and administrators working in the opera field. Mornings are dedicated to the exploration of opera chorus pieces and ensemble work, while the afternoons are programmed more for the individual. Participants can choose two electives per week which include masterclasses in vocal technique, dramatic interpretation in opera, production (stage management, theatre make-up application and techniques, prop building), stage combat, smaller ensembles and solo work for singers, drama and design. The program concludes with an informal presentation for family and friends at the end of each week. No audition is required.\n\n### Isn’t opera for adults?\n\nNot in the least. Opera can be enjoyed by all ages. But there are different methods of being introduced to opera. SYI’s method is a hands-on and interactive approach. Many of the individuals who participate have had some experience in the performing arts, either performing in musicals at school or with community theatres, in choirs, and some have had voice, instrumental music, acting and/or dance lessons. Not everyone has had extensive training in opera, nor should they, as the participants range from ages 13 to 18\\. Despite all of the young “opera” singers emerging from TV shows like “[name the country]’s Got Talent,” it takes time and patience and years of hard work (not a quick three-minute spot on TV!) to become an opera singer or a member of an opera chorus, a musician in the orchestra pit, a designer, etc…you get my drift. Your body needs to grow into it. It’s in this spirit that we program SYI. Our artists approach each young voice, each budding designer, each musician and each emerging director with care and diligence and from their current level of experience and ability. The artists engage, excite, inspire and challenge. That is how you open the doors to the professional world of opera to the young artist, regardless of their chosen discipline.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429820036880/IMG_0177lightened_resized.jpg)\n</figure>\n\n### What do the participants learn at the SYI?\n\nThere is so much learning in one week that it’s hard to condense into one short paragraph. The program focuses on the development of the individual’s performing arts skills and general life skills, like creativity, collaboration, responsibility and self-confidence. Specific learning includes: singing operatic repertoire that is safe and appropriate for their young developing voices, how to prepare for auditions, how to approach text and music in opera from the perspective of a singer, director and designer, how to deliver a punch or an upper cut safely on stage, the skills and methods needed in designing an opera, and learning about the many careers in the industry.\n\n### What do you enjoy about your work with this program?\n\nI see all of the COC programs as my children, so I probably shouldn’t play favourites, but SYI is one of my top three programs that we run. I love witnessing the courageousness of the participants and how they apply themselves over the course of a week. For some it's overcoming shyness, reaching that high or low note that they’ve struggled with for months, trusting that their vulnerability will enhance and deepen the expression of a piece, or coming up with a brilliant design. They inspire me and the artists to work harder in providing these types of experiences for young people.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429819974790/IMG_0079lightened_resized.jpg)\n</figure>\n\n### What kind of feedback have you gotten from past participants?\n\nFeedback from last year’s participants included: · “You will learn more about opera, you will have fun, and you will feel safe, comfortable and welcomed.” · The aspect of SYI that appealed to me most: “Expanding my musical horizons and getting better/polishing the things I am already good at. I had never sung opera before this program and it was cool to learn how to change my sound.” · “The diversity. Even though it’s an “opera camp” everything you learn can be applied to all fields of performing.” Overall, the participants valued working with professional artists who encouraged them to develop their artistic abilities, while providing a nurturing and safe environment for the young people to take risks. Many commented on an increase in their confidence, increased enthusiasm for the art form, and a commitment to keep learning about and honing their craft.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429819890710/IMG_0077lightened_resized.jpg)\n</figure>\n\n### How do opera programs directed towards youth help the opera industry?\n\nOpera programs for youth help the industry in two ways: they nurture talent and support young artists who might choose to pursue a career path in opera in the future, and secondly, and for me most importantly, they demonstrate that there is a place for youth in opera and that the art form is not just for an older generations. The introductions that youth receive through hands-on and active explorations and interactions with professionals in the field cultivate their appreciation for the art form. Many return to the COC in some capacity – as volunteers, as program assistants for programs and workshops for children, as audience members, and one participant has even returned as a member of the Ensemble Studio! Mezzo-soprano [Danielle MacMillan](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=24212) participated in the COC’s Opera Jam for youth in 2005 (a program in which youth created their own opera). Danielle had a great voice and her teacher encouraged her to sign-up for Opera Jam. After years of voice lessons and training, Danielle was accepted into the COC’s [Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/aboutthecoc/companymembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx).\n<div class=\"intro\">The Summer Youth Intensive program is seriously great stuff.

        "body": "I'm working on an opera right now, and this week, we go into tech week. It's a week where the role of the pianist becomes humbling. The tech rehearsals are so _not_ about the music. The director and his crew of lighting and set designers take over the game, and in the best cases, it's for a great reason. It means that there will be costumes, sets, and spectacular theatrical sleights-of-hand to complete that magical music that the pianist loves so much. We are invited to remember how opera is theatre, not a concert. Humbling indeed. So there the pianist sits, alone in the empty orchestra pit, out of sight and out of mind to most. The cast and crew look down at him or her, with a look of amused pity in their eyes, as they wave and say something like, \"How's it going down there?\" The answer is: slightly deflated.\n\nTech week also means the orchestra enters the picture, and I hope I'm not the only coach who still feels a pang of emotional struggle during this sensitive time. I remember the first time I worked as a _répétiteur_; when the orchestra rehearsals began and we moved from the rehearsal space into the theatre, I was extremely hurt. Irrationally so. I smile now thinking of it, but I remember feeling like all my creative efforts had been coldly torn away from me. By the time tech week begins, there are three people who know the opera like the back of their hand: the director, the conductor, and the _répétiteur_. Every corner, every dramatic and rhythmic beat, every line of harmony and every single word of the libretto are seared into the minds of this powerful triumvirate. And then, it gets (temporarily) torn to pieces.\n\nLet me elaborate. From the point of view of a young, eager coach, the first impression of the orchestra is that it's an insensitive beast. I'll go back to my own naïve thoughts during my first experience with an operatic orchestra rehearsal. Who _were_ these players, I thought, playing their parts with indifference? Didn't the string section _understand_ what was happening to my beloved operatic characters during those lush melodies? Violins, _why_ are you playing her aria like that? Don't you know what she's _been through_? Who did these (very skilled) players think they were, stomping through exquisite moments of dramatic tension like it were simply some notes on a page?\n\nI felt like I had been replaced by a mob of uncaring, innocently ignorant musicians. Even worse was when I joined the orchestra as simply another cog in the machine; my individual part looked ridiculous and bare, like I had spent weeks looking at a beautiful sunset, only to have someone force me to watch the grand finale through a keyhole. I sat, fidgeting, on the piano/keyboard/celesta bench, unable to see the show or hear any of the singers clearly, feeling frustrated and left out. I did not like this turn of events, just when the creative process was getting interesting.\n\nThe best coaches are control freaks anyway, so I think the emotional conflict that comes with tech week is really much more simple than any of the above. It's about: _I wanna do it_. And that's problematic, considering the coach's job description. Before tech week, the job is: make sure the singers are prepared, and facilitate rehearsals by re-creating the orchestra's parts at the piano. Coaches love to work from the piano, and I'm guilty of getting hooked on it. My personal favourite rehearsal for an opera is the piano dress rehearsal. You get to play the whole opera without stopping, and the show is (theoretically) polished and ready to go. But here's the catch: the piano dress rehearsal is _no one else's favourite rehearsal_. If we're being honest, the singers and conductor are sort of sick of the piano. They're eager to hear that orchestra. I remember playing a piano dress of _Carmen_, my whole body vibrating with concentration and adrenaline from those final incredible pages; when we finished, I felt like I could lift a house. When I looked around at the rest of the cast, they looked exhausted and sort of bored. I realized I was alone in my joy. Sigh.\n\nThere's no profound point to this rambling. In my old age, I realize that the pianist's job simply gets more interesting, if less pianistic. We stay busy by acting as extra ears for the maestro, for the singers. We furiously take notes about where the singers get drowned out by that powerful (and thrilling) orchestra. We encourage the singers to point their voices downstage as much as possible, and to make the spit to in the name of clear text. We get to be the bridge between director, conductor and singer, and all it takes is the sacrifice for a bow onstage at the end of it all. Once you're over that, you can get to some decent work. There's a perfectly relevant saying: \"There is no limit to the good a man can do if he doesn't care who gets the credit.\"",

He's taken an opera that is fairly rare in the grand scheme (but known to the operatic community at large), and makes it accessible, sensitive, nuanced, and decidedly impressionistic.\n\nThe cellular composition of the piece doesn't lend itself to any ensemble singing (nor was any written), and the \"arias\" are really  genuine monologues or soliloquies with little repetition and a lot of information. The storyline of a young lady Mélisande (Khalil) discovered in the woods by Prince Golaud (Gregory Dahl - #swoon), married and brought home only to have the consequences of her arrival destroy the house of King Arkel (Coulombe #doubleswoon) and bring about the end of the idealistic Pelléas (Dupuis - #tripleswoontimesinfinity). My only issue was that the non-linear timeline would have been helped by the addition of dates or a \"six months later\" to the location slides in the surtitles. That being said it was the only thing I missed.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429818953613/blockd-3237-1024x683.jpg)\n<figcaption>Alain Coulombe and Miriam Khalil. Photo by Darryl Block.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFirst let it be known, there is no tenor in this show. Sorry bro, next time.\n\nNow down to brass tacks.\n\nSoprano [Miriam Khalil](http://www.miriamkhalil.com/Home.html) shows us once again why she's one of Canada's best young sopranos. Her voice is silky, smoky, and so very expressive. Coupled with her strong acting choices and her remarkably exotic look, it's easy to understand why her Mélisande brings all the boys to the yard.\n\nAs the lovestruck Pelléas, baritone [Étienne Dupuis](http://www.ariamanagement.com/en/nos-artistes/etienne-dupuis-w/) lulls you into a false sense of security and \"piano\" in the first act, only to unleash the full breadth of his masculine, lyrical tone in the second. The use of straight tones alongside full, free singing added a depth of brushstroke to the music that truly supported Pelléas's emotional journey.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429819015554/blockd-2869-1024x758.jpg)\n<figcaption>Etienne Dupuis. Photo: Darryl Block.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe most thrilling for me was none other than [Gregory Dahl](http://www.gregorydahl.com/) as Prince Golaud. Not to mention he sings like a god, but his characterization was so nuanced you could easily understand how his love can push him into obsession. I was particularly entranced in his scene with the lovely young soprano [Andrea Nuñez](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/artists/533c48810082a28353000000) in a pants role as Golaud and Melisande's son Yniold. Their energy was palpable and Nuñez's Yniold showed us a mature young performer poised to take the opera world by storm.\n\nTwo of my all-time favourites rounded out this cast of superb singers. Bass [Alain Coulombe](http://www.alaincoulombe.com/) was remarkable. His lower register filled the Tanenbaum Courtyard with aplomb. Mezzo-soprano Megan Latham, usually a bright star in every performance, sounded a little thin in the outdoor courtyard (which is not something experienced when Ms. Latham is heard indoors to be certain, clearly this was environmental), but her stately Geneviève was a clinic in how to portray a lady of class properly onstage.\n\n[Camelia Koo](http://www.catalysttcm.com/camelliakoo.html)'s set and [Jason Hand](http://www.jasonhandlighting.com/)'s lighting once again blow my mind. The use of the location and grassy portions to represent water with lily-pad stones strewn about to as bridges for the actors to walk on was a simple visual metaphor that didn't leave the theatric neophyte confused; couple that with Hand's masterful understanding of how to make artificial light look natural provided us with a moonlight that was both warm and decidedly French. [Ming Wong](http://www.mingwongdesign.com/)'s costumes were a cut above the rest, we should all be lucky enough to be dressed by her.\n\nThe orchestra in pianist [Julien LeBlanc](http://www.julienleblanc.com/)'s fingers lent a subtlety and finesse to Debussy's keyboard which is essential in successfully creating the impressionist composer's decidedly eponymous harmonies.\n\nI loved this show. I loved the space, I loved the treatment. I loved seeing the smile on Stuart Hamilton's face at the end of each act. The design is gorgeous, and above all it's supberbly sung and acted. Thanks again, Against The Grain Theatre, for showing us how opera should be done! Bravi Tutti.\n\nHONORABLE MENTION: The trio of wild birds that helped underscore the first act, actually lent to the outdoor freshness of the setting without detracting from the music and action.",

I get that. It's not true, though, that all opinions warrant equal amounts of respect. Tamar Iveri (and/or, perhaps, [her husband](http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/388712,opera-australia-parts-company-with-tamar-iveri.aspx)) showed gross levels of homophobia and ignorance, and recklessly low levels of professional tact. I _suppose_ a personally-held belief that homosexuals are comparable to \"fecal masses\" is harmless enough if it stays an inner-monologue; homophobia _could_ get a pass if it resulted in no action that harmed others. But Tamar works in a gay-is-normal industry, and her opinions were articulated publicly. What had she been thinking of her fellow colleagues during her contracts in Vienna, Paris and Munich? Did she not notice that the potentially gay singers, directors, conductors, and coaches she worked with were also a talented bunch, with more to them than their sexual preferences?\n\nSo, no: not all opinions are valid, and we don't have to give reverence to all of them. Some of them are based on ignorance and stubbornness. I'm glad she's dealing with some tangible consequences, beyond the [circus of angry commenters on her Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/tamariverisoprano?fref=nf). You don't get to spew uninformed \"beliefs\" and continue to work within an industry that's grown out of such cretinous discrimination.\n\nOpera Australia hasn't yet announced who will take over for Tamar in _Otello_; the role of Desdemona is no longer included in the [cast list on OA's website](https://opera.org.au/whatson/events/otellosydney). I applaud them for listening to the public's response in regards to Tamar's contract in Sydney. We'll see what the future holds for this opinionated lady.",

It tells a poignant story of Solana, a young lesbian from Montréal who has shunned society's edicts on what a woman is, should be, and how she should behave. We find her as she's seeking out her one lost love, Lilah. The opera lends credibility to the fictional country where the action takes place by making Solana from an actual city here in Canada - that happens to be one of my favourites, even if I'm yet to have a cronut. The piece is actually in a dystopian country called Fundamentalia - which is exactly what it sounds like. Deviation from patriarchal/antiquated gender roles is one of many things apparently punishable by death.\n\nWe hear of the love between Lilah and Solana, sung respectively by sopranos [Stephanie Yelovich](https://twitter.com/sopsyelovich) and [Teiya Kasahara](http://www.teiyakasahara.com/teiyakasahara/welcome.html), their separation and then their reunion. A beautiful, sensuous reunion of two genuine amantes, that is sharply interrupted and violently challenged by the arrival of Lilah's husband Javan - who's got secrets of his own.\n\nIf you have not heard [Teiya Kasahara](http://www.teiyakasahara.com/teiyakasahara/welcome.html) sing, you are missing out. I mean this. Go now. Don't wait. Run, don't walk. An alumna of the COC Ensemble Studio, Teiya uses her unique voice (I'm remiss to use that word because it really doesn't describe its rarity) to bring us a Solana that's textured, layered, and passionate. Within the first 3 minutes of the opera during which Kasahara gives a clinic on what I would like to call Dramatic Coloratura. There was Verdi in her voice just as there was Monteverdi. She carries this show easily and never fails to thrill.\n\n[Stephanie Yelovich](https://twitter.com/sopsyelovich), a voice with which I'm not familiar (and a situation I intend to rectify), did a great job at portraying the struggle between her love for Solana and her duty to her husband and child - not to mention the consequences should their love be discovered. This is not an easy journey for any actor. The voice is full, dark and loaded with potential. Her treatment and navigation of the vocal lines was top-drawer, I feel like she may have less experience on stage in her CV as sometimes I found her physicality to be a bit on the demonstrative side. Yet there are moments of brilliance as in the scene where she actually begins to succumb to her feelings and she sings with Solana for the first time, and demontrativeness in your acting is something that will disappear with experience. You can see the longing in her eyes, hear it in her voice but most importantly, you can feel it in her breath. She's a soprano to watch - for sure.\n\nThe voice I'm most familiar with, and the most surprised by, came out of baritone [Keith Lam](https://twitter.com/baritonekeith): a spritely little chap with a deceptively suave, masculine, sizeable tone. A dramatic entrance filled with rage sends him to the top of his range, which he continually navigates through the majority of the piece. This time around, Lam employed more facets of his voice to produce a new palette of colours I'm not used to hearing from him. His past few years' work with Tafelmusik and Opera Atelier have really released an extra level of expressive quality, bringing out falsetto, broadway, straight tones, all mixed and matched with a full-throated romantic baritone-claw-worthy lyric vocalism that really helped to colour Javan and build for him the pathos with the audience his character desperately needs.\n\nUyeda's composition of a libretto by poet [Rachel Rose](http://www.rachelrose.ca/) is finessed, lush when it needs to be and utilizes consonant harmonies sparingly to highlight the underlying angst of the characters caught in an oppressive regime, and to really showcase the moments of true happiness. I loved the feeling of \"Is this the right decision?\" that the postlude left in the audience. Uyeda's vocal lines were melodious, musical, and above all SINGABLE! The pitfall for a lot of contemporary works (and I've sung and staged my fair share) is that in an effort to create the perfect musical landscape, the composer often is quite insensitive to the limitations of the human voice. Not Uyeda. Her understanding of fach, range and even vowel selection shows a deft hand that understands both the needs of the singer and the needs of the audience.\n\nThe story is relevant, poignant, and transferrable to any community I see in the news. The struggles the characters face are real, and the stakes are high. I can relate to this show on a thousand personal levels, as I'm sure everyone else in the room did, and as I'm sure anyone else who hears it will.\n\n_Bravi tutti_.\n\nHONOURABLE MENTION: Although this was a very small and intimate performance, the diction in this show is incredible. Even with the sopranos working their magic in their upper ends, any vowel modification is forgiven by the complete understanding of every consonant uttered. Bravi!\n\n_When the Sun Comes Out_ plays once more tonight. Catch it, you must. [Details and tickets here](http://wtscotheopera.bpt.me/).",

        "body": "### What's your favourite part about your work as a lighting designer?\n\nThe best days are when I get asked to work on an interesting story with a director and set designer who want to make it something unique.  Spending time creating shows alongside driven, creative people makes me work harder.  I love the early design meetings with the director and the other designers.  Those are the meetings when the world of the opera is created. Every director works differently at this stage (the variety is part of the fun) but when there's a good team, there are always engaging discussions.\nAnother favourite day of mine is the technical work-through of the show.  Usually 12 hours long, it's the day during technical rehearsals when we finally bring all the elements together: staging is adjusted, lighting is reworked (and then reworked again), and the timing of every entrance is tested.  Sometimes it lasts 2 or 3 days on a big show, or sometimes only a few hours on an even bigger opera.  The work-through is high-pressure and all-consuming.  I love it.\n\n### How does lighting design make or break a show?\n\nActually, I don't believe that lighting has that ability... nor does scenic or sound design.\nLet me explain it this way: you can sit down in a beautifully decorated restaurant, with great service and perfectly plated dishes.  In the end, if the food is overcooked, bland and leathery, then the meal is a failure.  No amount of tarting it up can save it and nobody raves about a restaurant whose greatest achievement is the wallpaper.  I've seen brilliant shows with terrible design, and I've still have enjoyed them.  Now I'm not suggesting that design isn't valuable: when it pushes hard against a good story, it takes the experience to another level.  It can give great performers the best possible platform from which to grab the audience.  When all the design disciplines work together, the result can be astounding.  But it only works if it's all in support of good storytelling.  Otherwise, it's just trashy special effects.\n\n### You’ve worked with AtG several times before. Why do you enjoy working with Joel Ivany and his team?\n\nI've designed 4 other shows for Against the Grain: _Pelléas et Mélisande_, _Figaro's Wedding_, _Turn of the Screw_, and _La bohème_.  Each one has been produced in a different space under a totally new set of circumstances.  We had no dimmers or lighting inventory for _La bohème_ or _Figaro's Wedding_, and we had theatrical lighting along with some moving lights for _Turn of the Screw_ and _Pelléas_.  We had a tiny crew for _Figaro_, and then the backing of the COC for _Pelléas_.  There is no standard configuration for an Against the Grain show, and so there are no aesthetic expectations.  The audience at AtG shows have only two regular expectations when they buy their ticket: they know that they're going to get world-class performances and that Joel is going to turn it in to something unique.  That's what I enjoy about the company: Joel thinks up the best way to tell the story, then rebuilds the company each time in order to make it happen.\n### Does an outdoor venue like the Cave and Basin present any unique challenge to your job?\n\nOutdoor theatre is always tricky because you can't control the weather or the sunset.  While we are creating the show, the sun will be setting 2 minutes earlier each night.  That may not seem significant, but consider this: the first day of rehearsal a 3-minute aria might happen at 8:45pm, before the sun starts to dip.  A week later, it will still happen at 8:45pm but now it will be dusk, the singer lit nicely by the sunset.  Two days later, we will be relying on mostly on theatre lighting.  It adds up!  Between the start of technical rehearsals and the closing night, there will be change in the sunset time by about 30 minutes.  It has a huge impact on the needs of the lighting rig, and that's without even considering the day-to-day changes in cloud cover.  Those variables means that the show will look different each night, and the design needs to account for all of it.\nIt gets even trickier.  Not only can we only do full technical rehearsals at night, but we also have to be careful to rehearse the show in real-time as much as possible.  Starting on time is critical, which puts added pressure on the stage management team.  If we stop a run for too long to solve a staging problem, then we risk getting out of sync with the sunset.  There's no negotiating with the earth's rotation!\n\nBeyond the weather and the sunlight, there are additional technical obstacles when designing outside.  It's obvious that we aren't doing this in a conventional theatre.  For me that means that there is no lighting inventory, no dimmers, no lighting desk, no pre-installed infrastructure of any kind.  If I need something, it has to be found or rented, then brought in.  Additionally, it has to be weather-proofed.  Electricity and water have never really gotten along well.  At first, this extra technical baggage might feel very limiting.  But when there is no traditional stage to consider, and no lighting positions, then you have to think about the design differently.  What can I provide to the audience so that they better understand this story?  Do they really need people to be lit by me in order to see them, or is daylight enough?  How does the lighting focus the audience's attention on a an entrance?  Does it even need to?  Everything the audience sees in the space is going to inform their understanding of the opera.  Even the choice of house lights (typically not negotiable in a conventional theatre space) will help shape the atmosphere.  So what do we want the audience to feel when the walk into the venue, and how should that mood change throughout the opera?  How theatrical should the lighting be?  Or maybe it's better if we just accept that this story is happening in front of us, today, in Banff and not in Seville in the 17th century?  Is that context critical?  Patrick Du Wors (set and costume designer), Joel Ivany (director), and I are all going to be pushing on these questions throughout the next few weeks at we create space where we will show off Joel's new adaptation.\n\n### What will you do during your down time in Banff?\n\nI can't wait to do some hiking and some quiet reading in the Park.  However, time off from #UncleJohn is likely going to be filled with work on my upcoming shows. Joel has asked me to light his production of Carmen this fall at the Vancouver Opera so we will have lots of work to do on that one.  It's going to be a busy few weeks, but I couldn't imagine a better location for a design studio.\n\nStay posted at www.schmopera.com to meet the rest of the _#UncleJohn_ crew, and to catch the latest happenings here in Banff.",

        "body": "If I were the artistic director of my own opera company, I'd probably enjoy putting up whatever shows I please. There would be a lot of Britten in my seasons. The question would be, would people want to go see the shows I like best?\n\nIt's an important question, because it gets us to the topic of getting more and more people to the opera (willingly, even). When a company decides what shows will make up a season, it's a fair assumption that, mixed in with some of the opera bosses' personal favourites, they'll choose at least _some_ shows that the average audience member would want to go and see. They'll try to cover the aesthetic gamut: some Puccini that's easy on the ears, some Verdi with grandeur and famous tunes, some Mozart or Rossini for comedy, and maybe some Wagner to prove that theirs is a Serious Opera Company. A show by Britten, perhaps, or even something _even more modern_, will be gingerly placed into the season, often in the same way that one picks up an overused dish sponge and tosses it in the trash.\n\nSo, what's so bad about trying to offer up a season of operas that cover different styles and time periods? Nothing, except the time and energy spent on the decisions are surprisingly wasted. Ironically, the people making these decisions are poorly equipped to judge what a general audience wants to see. Opera folks simply aren't like other folks (and I wouldn't have it any other way). But even if their oddities could be tempered, they're still too well-informed. I've had conversations with colleagues about how certain operas grew on them; they worked on a show, or saw it a bunch of times by accident, and they grew to love the piece. That's great, but where does that leave the potential audience, who didn't spend months immersed in the piece and has yet to even see it? The general public knows good drama, because they watch _Breaking Bad_, and they know how music moves us, because they go to _Les Misérables_ and listen to the Rolling Stones. Opera is on par with _these_ art forms; it is not above nor aside, and it is definitely not exempt.\n\nThink about it: if you were to ask a slice of the general public what operas they'd like to see this season, they might shrug, or ask you to repeat the question. This doesn't mean that the general public are stupid consumers of lesser art forms. It just means that opera isn't as familiar to them as television or even straight theatre. It should be liberating to the opera bosses to know that a \"well-chosen\" line-up of shows does not decide how large the audiences will be. They don't need to worry about it. I'll say it again: what's worth worrying about is story-telling.\n\nIt really is as simple as that. I don't even have to qualify that the chosen opera should be a \"good\" one, that the words and music should be well-crafted and all that; if an opera really does tell a story, these elements are in place by default. The corollary is also true: if an opera doesn't have something to say, it doesn't matter who wrote it or how old it is. It's simply not going to move people. I have trouble with a lot of _bel canto_ repertoire, for example, because in it I haven't been able to find a story that can be told today without multiple layers of apologetics and contexts in the way. Sure, the music is stunning, and the vocal feats required of the singers are extraordinary. To be fair, the function of _bel canto_ is to clear the way for gorgeous singing; but if you're not equipped to really appreciate it, all the beautiful Bellini tunes in the world couldn't make up for the fact that there are obvious and distracting weaknesses in the plots. \n\nI've said it before: we should take stock of these so-called canonical pieces, and re-evaluate their stage potential today. If the goal is to prove that opera is relevant, let's be done with opera plots that feature hyperbolic emotional reactions and failed communication between characters. And if the goal is to tell a story, then a company will opt for shows with the potential to do so.\n\nI asked colleague and friend [Topher Mokrzewski](https://twitter.com/Tophski), music director of [Against the Grain Theatre](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/), how he and artistic director [Joel Ivany](https://twitter.com/joelivany) choose their seasons. He answered simply: \"We just do whatever the hell we want to.\" It sounds glib, but AtG's history of sold-out shows supports my theory that it's not _what_ you put on, but _why_. \n\nI don't doubt that the aim of many major opera companies is to wow their audiences and get them to come back. But is it too much to ask that they attempt to produce at least a few shows that don't need a pre-show talk or a skim through the synopsis in advance? These are the things that make opera inaccessible, especially when there exist other forms of theatre that are densely creative and don't require an introductory course? \n\nIf Wagner's Ring Cycle will move people, it's not because [Carl Jung](http://stottilien.com/2012/07/19/c-g-jung-and-wagner-rainy-gotterdammerung-in-munich/) or because [_leitmotif_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif#Wagner) or because [Wagner tuba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_tuba). It's because the entire creative team has stuck to its goal of telling the epic tale, and knowing the role of the music. For those outside of the small, _small_ world of opera, it's not true that there exist certain pieces that stand on their own. It's the job of the creative team to _show_ the audience the story in the text, and what the music has to say about it. And it's the job of those in charge of a company to hire directors and conductors willing to take on the task.\n\nI love that opera folks are odd. They understand the potential of the human voice, what harmony and melody can do to words (and vice versa), and they become history and literature buffs in the meantime. I challenge major companies to decide not what show they want to put up, but _what they want to say_. It means they may have to ignore \"suggestions\" from puritan opera subscribers or even donors, and be brave enough to rediscover the task of story-telling. If snobby feathers are ruffled, so be it. Anyone who's tried to put up an opera (and I mean from  within the rehearsal room) knows that there's no room for ego in this art form. Shouldn't that trend start with the opera bosses?",

        "body": "Guys, maybe we are a little elitist...\n\nSo. On [quartz.com](http://quartz.com/) recently there was a piece by a young soprano named Chelsea Feltman entitled [\"Don't Ask a Young Opera Singer These Three Questions\"](http://qz.com/228483/dont-ask-a-young-opera-singer-these-three-questions/#/h/83373,2/). This piece has kinda been written before, but that's fine, and there were some pretty [funny animations done about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6UPzuQvFjE) from a stage actor's perspective circling around about four years ago.\n\nIn her piece she says some pretty powerful things. I can get behind her statements about American Idol. That's a popular music competition and our remarkable techniques don't always translate well to the Debbie Gibson I - V - IV chord progressions. Her third argument about Jackie Evancho I don't really want to entertain until that young lady has gone through some conservatory training, we don't know, she could be the next Callas.\n\nHer second point revolves around a quintessential masterwork of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber. \"_The Phantom of the Opera_,” despite having the word in its title, is not actually an opera,\" she says.\n\nI. Beg. To. Differ.\n\nSo because I've had this conversation (I'm not joking) with most of my colleagues in the professional Canadian opera scene, I thought it might be nice to put it to pen, and enlist some special help.\n\nThrough my association with [Toronto Operetta Theatre](http://torontooperetta.com/), I've had the opportunity to work with excellent singers and actors, truly some of the best in the biz. I'll never forget the day I showed up to rehearsal to work with one of my high school heroes - Ms. Elizabeth DeGrazia. For the painfully unaware, Ms. DeGrazia was Toronto's resident Christine in _Phantom_ for the majority of its run. I thought I'd ask her what she thought of all this.\n\n\"Andrew's _Phantom of the Opera_ in my opinion is an opera.\" Yes, obviously she would be on a first name basis with one of the most successful musical composers of the 20th century, and I totally agree with her. \"It has half a dozen leading roles, a chorus of opera singers, and a ballet core. The three elements in most of the traditional operas.\" she said to me in an email recently. \"It is almost completely sung from downbeat to the final curtain.\" \n\nA great point. \"One might argue that the spoken dialogue, what little there is, could be _sprechstimme_ (\"songspeak\") - including some of the recitatives before the arias.\" The main point surrounding the dialogue being they didn't receive a separate script (called, aptly, 'the book') it was all included and underscored. To be fair, it has far less spoken dialogue than either _Die Zauberflöte_ or _Carmen_ so that can't be it... \n\nSo clearly it's gotta be the subject matter that's holding _Phantom_ out of the realm of opera. Well, Elizabeth points out that the themes of _Phantom_ are no different than that of most other grand operas that involve a tragic love story. \n\nSo, then it's got to be the technique employed to sing the score, right? Well, looking back, we have had some serious opera singers grace the stage of the Pantages in this production, and good luck singing Carlotta as a belter. Also, as a crossover artist myself, I take exception to that line of thought. \n\nSo what is it then? I think Elizabeth hits the nail on the head when she said \"The only thing to me that makes _The Phantom of the Opera _a musical form is that it is performed eight times week. If it was performed three nights a week, musical terminology would never even come into the fray...\" Oddly enough though, _La bohème_ ran on Broadway for eight shows a week (albeit with rotating casts) for 228 shows, and clearly no-one is running to re-classify \"Quando m'en vo\" or \"Che gelida manina\" as showtunes.\n\nSo by all these arguments it's totally an opera. Top to bottom. So why does Ms. Feltman make such a statement after being educated in a top-of-the-heap conservatory at Juilliard? To be fair, I've heard this argument from more than just her, some of my \"purist\" colleagues (whom I respect and admire very much) have said the same thing. Why? And why this show in particular? Opera houses have started appropriating a fair amount of Broadway in recent memory; I think of a fully-operatic cast singing _Phantom,_ and you know what? In my head, it sounds exactly the same.\n\nLet's not forget the inclusion of pieces like Kurt Weill's [_Street Scene_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmzscAYfSWI), Bernstein's [_West Side Story_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74UmUhAsMgM), and Sondheim's [_Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWA-eRewQrA) in the modern operatic canon. If there's a place in an opera house for \"[America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4lOWfgD5s)\" in _West Side Story_, then there's room for \"[Prima Donna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0n04m__mJ0)\" from _Phantom_.\n\nAbout halfway through, she changes the thesis of her piece to pontificate lightly on the perceived death of opera and offers this gem \"Every morning, I see at least five new articles lamenting the 'death of opera' in the USA and around the world. Major houses are struggling to stay afloat financially, and smaller houses are simply closing down... Everyone agrees that something is wrong, but how to fix it?\"\n\nAhhh.... so that's what this article is actually about.\n\nShe mentions the different opinions of various people (audience, performers, creatives, etc..), the view that it's \"elitist or irrelevant\", that opera needs to \"get with the times\" to attract more audiences. Ironically, she's propagating the \"elitist\" image with the very opening of this piece.\n\nPeople think that opera is pretentious and elitist exactly because of shit like this. It wasn't written by Verdi, or Mozart, or Puccini, or one of the \"-inis or -ettis\", so it's not opera. Look: just because it ran for eight shows a week, doesn't mean it's any less of a full score. I feel perhaps some of this pretense is born out of envy for fact that they lack the kind of stamina needed to do eight performances in a week (oddly enough, a lot of them totally could do right a week and not break a sweat). Think about it, singing a double-header of _Butterfly_ or _Tosca_ on Wednesdays and Sundays at 230PM and 730PM so that you can have your one day a week off (removes to the corner in fetal position).\n\nSo what's my point?\n\nWith regards to _The Phantom of the Opera_ itself, the score is really worth a re-listen. I recommend the Canadian Cast Recording featuring Rebecca Caine as Christine Daae. Listen to it, but don't focus on the popular gems (\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\", \"Music of the Night\", \"All I Ask Of You\") and really spend time with the big, intricately composed ensemble numbers (\"Masquerade\", \"Notes\", and the \"Rehearsal Scene for _Don Juan Triumphant_\") and you'll hear a lush, intricate piece that harkens to turn-of-the-century Romantics like Puccini and Cilea with some remarkably difficult, complex ensemble singing. (Yes, I'm aware of the whole _La fanciulla del West_ hullabaloo, but that's been settled by the parties involved and should be left where it is, in history, so we can focus on enjoying the fact that at least it was good music.)\n\nThese are the kinds of conversations I like having with my colleagues. Showing them how opera isn't dying, it didn't disappear, it's just that we behaved like pretentious jerks at the time new pieces were introduced.\n\nAnd then we turn around almost 30 years later and wonder why everyone calls us elitist.\n\nP(arting)S(hots) in the words of Elizabeth DeGrazia: \"I can only tell you that when I sang six shows a week of _Phantom_ (two shows a week went to the understudy - ed.) I was very happy I was operatically trained at the Conservatory of Music.\"",

        "body": "Our jobs must seem quite surreal to the average person. The opera industry is full of professional travellers; singers, conductors, directors, coaches, stage managers and designers are often in a constant state of transit. It's not uncommon for an opera-type's calendar to feature three weeks in Toronto, two in Montreal, a four-week audition tour throughout Europe, and three nights in New York, all back-to-back. We tell our less artsy friends about our work, and the consensus is that our lifestyle sounds \"glamourous\". And there are certainly parts of it that are indeed glamourous. Opera folk are well-traveled, often multi-lingual, with a huge circle of friends and colleagues from around the world. They work in theatres and concert halls, which is a cool idea in itself. They seem to jet-set from gig to gig, and I suppose the average person imagines an opera singer's travel experience is a slightly tamer version of the [Beatles' arrival in America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df-LvrRcEo), touching down on a runway and rushing off to the concert stage to accept their applause. For those who choose to make a career out of making opera, travel is a necessity; but at what cost?\n\nIf we go right to the source and ask opera folk about said \"glamour\" in their career, the first response might be closer to a deep sigh and a loaded \"Yeah, it is.\" Because the price of all this fabulousness is time, time that could be spent with family and loved ones. I've spoken to many colleagues and friends-in-the-biz about this, often when we're both away from home at a gig. They tell me about the massive highs and lows that can come in one night from singing on the stage at the Met, and then leaving the theatre to go back to a lonely hotel room. Friends of mine speak about the life they have at home, with family and dog, and the injustice of never being in town to actually live it. I've experienced some of the more breathtaking moments in my life while traveling for work, and it's often hard to shake the feeling that I've spent those moments with the wrong people.\n\nSo we often envy the \"boring\" life. How refreshing would it be to have a nine-to-five job, with steady hours and pay, seeing our friends and families every day? Upon more thought, it occurred to me that the person with the \"normal job\" might spend their time trying to turn said job into a career, or at least something they love to do. Conversely, we artists spend years working on our craft, schlep through North America and Europe to audition for gigs away from home, all so that we can later pick and choose them more judiciously. At the very least we can hope to get paid enough money to fly our families around the globe with us. The traveling artist wants stability and they want to _unpack_, for Chrissake. The nine-to-fiver wants something new and exciting to happen to them, and they perhaps want to leave the country for the first time in their lives.\n\nIt's a case of the grass being greener, absolutely. And what to do? Are we too hard to please? Is a fulfilling and interesting career not enough? Must we also have all of our favourite people around too? The thought of trading it all in for a \"mundane\" life with Netflix and family dinners sounds delightful at times; but how long would it last before we craved our craft once more?\n\nSome people really do thrive on this kind of life; others find themselves at a crux, in which they seriously weigh all the things they love against each other. Some people take matters into their own hands by [starting their own opera company](http://againstthegraintheatre.com/) in whatever city they damn well please. They open a teaching studio, or even admirably straddle the worlds of day-jobs and opera gigs. But some of us are simply stubborn, and we want to do what we want to do; our homesickness and loneliness can, in some cases, be outweighed by the true love of our art. The joy and drive I feel at work make my head swim with inspiration.\n\nIn an interview she gave earlier this year, mezzo-soprano [Alice Coote](/talking-with-singers-alice-coote-mezzo-soprano/) said, \"The life has done terrible things to me, I'm not joking, this life on the road. But not to sing? I can't imagine...I just couldn't do anything else.\" At least we have an outlet in opera, one whose size matches our emotional peaks and valleys. When we miss our important people, and feel lonely or incomplete or depressed or in limbo, we can always find a way to throw it into our art.",

        "body": "Well, maybe not _everything_, but my title isn't tongue-in-cheek. I'm aware of the stereotypical opinions about singers that are held by instrumentalists within the classical music scenes; I won't say they're not there for a reason, but there's opportunity for learning between these seemingly polar points of origin in music. Now, singers and pianists work closely together within the opera industry; but when you really think about it, it's an odd pairing. On the one hand, the voice and the piano couldn't be more different, simply in terms of _how _they create sound. A singer takes a breath and sustains a (hopefully) lovely sound with control of air speed and resonance and other complicated things. A pianist pours their whole being into the attack of a note, into the initial moment of making sound; we have no say over what happens to the sound after we've hit the key. The quick nature of the piano keys are entirely different from the drawing of a bow on a string or sending air through a resonating chamber, and it results in a more immediate production of sound. Any pianist who has played in an orchestra knows that they'll be perpetually \"early\" in comparison with their string- and wind-playing colleagues.\n\nOn the other hand, singers are emulated by almost all other instruments; for example, string players learn the tricky technique of vibrato, using their left hand to mimic the voice's natural quavering effect on a sustained pitch. But the bigger picture of imitating singers comes from the idea of melody. Composers who get into writing good tunes know that they tend to rise and fall in a manner that resembles exaggerated speech; there's a natural peak to a phrase, swelling towards it and tapering off like a sort of release. The simplest point of reference could be the English sentence: \"I love you.\" Most people would start lower in the voice, rising quickly in pitch and emphasis towards the word \"love\", and easily relaxing through the word \"you\". You could emphasize the word \"I\" instead, or even the word \"you\", and get pretty different spins on the phrase's meaning; but there almost always exists some sort of arc in the voice. This is the stuff of good tunes, to be found in any Chopin Nocturne.\n\nAs a pianist who started off in my own little world of eighty-eight keys and a metronome, the idea of mimicry meant nothing to me. Who cares what _other_ instruments could do? I'm not picking up a violin, or a flute, or learning to sing; why are you bothering me with anecdotes about unrelated instruments? I remember the first time a piano teacher asked me to exhale during a particularly tricky passage of one of the Gershwin _Three Preludes_. He actually wrote it into my music, and I was disgusted. _Exhale_? Really?? What kind of head-in-the-clouds-type of pedagogy was this? Exhale. Psh. Turns out one of the benefits was oxygenating the muscles in my arms and hands in order to physically pull that tricky passage off. But aside from that, the idea of _breathing_, even while I played an instrument that didn't rely on wind to produce sound, started a profound learning curve for me that continued as I began to work with other musicians.\n\nThe final intermediary step was playing with cellists. There's plenty of talk about how the cello is the best imitator of the human voice, but the similarities are more interesting than quality of sound. I was playing Samuel Barber's Cello Sonata with a friend of mine during my time in university, and was frustrated with my repeatedly \"early\" arrival at a certain downbeat. I always made it there before my cellist friend. I was annoyed, because my metronome practice had been diligent, and I was subdividing like crazy. The fault must have been lying with my cellist partner; she was late. I reluctantly asked her about her rhythmic skills, and she told me about the huge, expansive distance that Barber had written between two notes in the cello part, the second of which was due to arrive on that pesky, problematic downbeat. She told me that it just wasn't possible for her to play the notes that Barber had indicated _and_ be perfectly on time with me. Now, that may or may not be true (I don't play the cello), but I remembered this encounter later on, once I began spending more and more time with singers.\n\nThe human voice has natural tendencies, and even natural limitations. In most cases, the wider the interval, the more time the voice needs to span it. I'm not saying they're sliding up and down like sirens; but if two notes cover a decent distance in the voice's natural range, the odds are greater that the distance includes a change in register, and requires more from the voice than a small, stepwise movement (proof: try it). The neat thing is that we, as humans who use our voices to communicate, understand this innately, and forgive it. So much so that this immeasurable time taken between a large interval finds its way into the unconscious imitation by almost every other instrument; it manifests itself into a more flexible version of rhythm. It becomes part of a musical phrase, an element that's crucial to keeping the music organic rather than robotic. The catch is, it's hard to write down.\n\nAnd therein lies the trap into which pianists fall. When a pianist mimics these vocal tendencies, it's all smoke and mirrors. We can't actually make two notes truly _legato_, but we can fake it, with plenty of practice. When we play with singers, we take on the task of accommodating that flexible rhythm in order to really make music with our partner. It seems arbitrary, even affected; but the way to pull it off is to breathe and sing, even from the piano. (Not necessarily in the way pianists like Victor Borge or Glenn Gould sing, although that's charming too.) Breathing and singing vicariously from the keyboard fill in the missing links between the physical natures of the voice and the piano.\n\nIn many cases, pianists don't learn to breathe in order to help their playing, because it seems practically unnecessary. But the voice and speech patterns are the starting points for music. In hindsight, it makes utter sense to include this in early piano pedagogy. There's this funny rivalry between instrumentalists and singers, and rhythm seems to fuel the fight. Pianists can improve their skills in _legato_, phrasing, and even rhythm, by leaning in closer and listening to singers. I know I'll never play a Chopin Nocturne the same way again.",

        "body": "\"We are willing to tighten our belts if Peter Gelb is willing to cut up his credit cards,\" [says Joe Hartnett of IATSE](http://www.burlington-record.com/burlington-sports/ci_26215053/lockout-looms-met-contracts-set-expire). \"It's more than just our labor costs that's the problem.\"\n\nIf you're reading this, you're probably already aware that the Metropolitan Opera is in trouble. This Thursday, the contracts of 15 unions are set to expire, and the negotiations between the unions and the Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, seem to be going nowhere good. A strike ([or lockout](http://online.wsj.com/articles/the-future-of-opera-1405641354), depending on which way you look) is looming, and it would delay or cancel the 2014/15 season set to start in September. Gelb has proposed cuts totalling $180 million (or roughly 16%) from the compensation of the chorus, orchestra, stage management, carpenters, stage hands, set designers, costume shop workers, stylists, ticket sellers and broadcast technicians. The cuts affect these employees' net pay, overtime, benefits, and pensions; members of some of the troubled unions say that after all the math is done, [the 16% will be closer to 30%](http://www.amny.com/news/metropolitan-opera-contract-negotiations-with-unions-drag-on-1.8859772).\n\nUnder Peter Gelb, the Met's annual budget has grown by over 50%; he doubled the amount of productions per season and introduced [Live in HD,](http://www.metopera.org/metopera/liveinhd/live-in-hd-2014-15-season) broadcasting selected live performances to movie theatres around North America. Say Gelb, \"When I took over the Met, the budget was about $200 million a year and we invested in new efforts to help make the opera more accessible and more successful.\" But the math of it all says Gelb simply didn't succeed. \n\n[Click here](http://www.local802afm.org/MetMusicians/2014-07-25_802-Presentation_Gelb.pdf) to read the fascinating breakdown of pre- and post-Gelb success, posted by Local 802, American Federation of Musicians. They measure reviews (most reflect well on the orchestra and singers, and poorly on the productions), and ticket revenue from Gelb revivals like the [Robert Lepage _Ring Cycle_](http://ringcycle.metoperafamily.org/)  (most take a clear nosedive after their opening runs).\n\nAnd [he spent $169, 000 on a poppy field](http://peoplesworld.org/metropolitan-opera-unions-say-they-are-being-forced-to-strike/) for _Prince Igor_. Come on.\n\nNow, when I look at the union stipulations currently in place, a few things make my eyebrows raise. For example, the chorus earns overtime for singing in an opera that lasts longer than four hours, meaning that Wagner can be a nice chunk of extra change. They're paid for 4 performances a week, and get compensated extra for rehearsals, even if they've only sung 3 shows that week. The orchestra musicians are among the most highly-compensated in the country, including anywhere between 10 and 16 weeks off per year, _paid_. The chorus and orchestra both get extra pay for appearing in the Met's cinecasts.\n\nAs a fairly young member of the opera industry, I often find it hard to sympathize with many of the Met's union stipulations. The idea of getting benefits and pensions with your _salary_ is pretty foreign to me, but I will be careful not to write out of envy. As with any industry, unions are good for securing jobs, but not good at promoting creativity. Stipulations, like these, that don't allow for time spent on _making a good product_ are short-sighted and anti-creative.\n\nI won't say the orchestra and chorus don't work hard for their money; they _absolutely_ do. And it's clear that Peter Gelb has now stretched the allowances within these unions over too many productions, too many of which simply haven't earned the interest of audiences or the respect of critics. It seems that on the management's side of things, the unfortunate truth is that _ego_ is in the way. It must be insulting to the creative team that actually put up Gelb's product to be expected to bear the first brunt of financial mess. Local 802 writes on their [website](http://www.local802afm.org/metorchestra/), \"Even if—after an objective analysis—the Met can be said to be facing some degree of financial challenge, it is clear what the solution isn’t. It isn’t slashing the compensation of the world-class performers and other craftspeople on whom the Met’s excellence and success relies.\"\n\nIt's a messy fight, and one with a rapidly decreasing time-line. The American Federation of Musicians [recently posted on their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/schmopera/posts/296341313871750), voicing their dismay at the apparent stand-still in union negotiations with the Met's management. The [Met has responded](http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Metropolitan-Opera-General-Manager-Peter-Gelb-Threatens-Lockout-and-Cancellation-of-Season-20140723#.U9KEwIBdXm4) in a frustratingly stubborn statement: \"We remain hopeful that the unions representing Met employees will recognize their need to share in the institution-wide cost controls we are proposing, and will reach an agreement before the contract expires on July 31\\. We hope to avoid any work stoppage and continue preparations for our season opening on Sept. 22.\"\n\nHope all you want, Mr. Gelb, but first leave your ego at the door. If your artistic vision depends on behemoth-like \"machines\" ([*Ringcyclecough*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R_kcWP0_SE)), pricey poppies and quantity of productions masked as quality, then no artists can carry that out for you. Certainly not after you take the first budgetary swipe at the most creative people in that big ol' building of yours.",

        "body": "The anticipation grows at the Metropolitan Opera; their negotiation period has been extended by 72hrs as of last night, in the hopes that the Met management and their union workers can do some math and share some hugs. I can't shake the feeling that the Met is hindered from making a respectful decision about the state of their company's books because of that pesky ego factor. The face of grandeur has been a long-standing staple at the Met, from the red-carpeted, Swarovsky-chandeliered lobby, to the very sights and sounds coming from the stage. It certainly is one-of-a-kind, that Met.\n\nThe concept of grandeur definitely appeals to the Met management, as well as to the steady audience members that return over multiple seasons, and even donate their cash to keeping it alive and \"well\". But considering that the Met, like almost all other North American opera companies, are seeking out a new, younger audience, they've made a fairly large oversight. Not everyone wants to do work for their entertainment. I'm not even talking about reading up on the complicated plots of *Le nozze di Figaro* or *Le comte d'Ory*. I'm talking about opera-goers who feel obligated to dress up, sit silently in their seat, and pay a good chunk of cash to do so. \n\nFor many people, these things simply do not outweigh the value of the show they saw that night. It's just not fun. And perhaps plenty of those folk are just not that into opera. Fair. But so many more of them are definitely into live entertainment. I get the sense that plenty of Met management (and donors, let's be honest) feel that if the public is unwilling to see an opera in its original language (albeit performed&nbsp;by spectacular singers and players), in a dark theatre from a far distance, then the Met does not want that public's business. To put it in my most sarcastic way: those who don't want to wear uncomfortable pants for hours, furiously reading surtitles&nbsp;and stifling yawns from the darkness and plush seats, aren't cut out for the opera. What garbage. Opera wouldn't have gotten past Monteverdi if people had been forced to \"enjoy\" it *only à-la-Met*.\n\nI'm not trying to say that the Met is outdated. It is what it is, and that's big, famous, and perhaps the best. I've personally had as many feasts of my eyes and ears as I have had squirming nights of out-of-tune singing and stage-by-numbers productions of *La bohème*. It's an experience, but it's not the best by default, at least not anymore.\n\nI've written about similar #operaproblems before. I think that the reluctance towards performing an opera in a smaller theatre, perhaps in the audience's native language, comes from a misunderstanding of the general reception of a great piece of opera. I'm the first person to drool over the significance of Verdi's harmonic changes on specific Italian syllables, and friends of mine swoon like enraptured nerds over the Tristan chord. If you're *really* into Mozart, reading the scores of *accompagnato* recits are like eavesdropping on that character's therapy session. These things are awesome. But they will be missed by most. It's the job of the director, conductor, singers, players, etc., to show an audience what these devices all *mean*. \n\nWhen black box theatre became a thing in the 60s and 70s, it might have looked cheap and lame to theatre folks. It no longer has that connotation, and opera has already started to adopt the benefits of a black box version of the genre.&nbsp;In a piece about [Against the Grain Theatre](http://atg.schmopera.com/)'s *#UncleJohn*, [Stephen Hunt](http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/festival-guide/Banff+transforms+into+opera+UncleJohn/10076789/story.html) at the *Calgary Herald* put it well: \"If food can get slower (and better), if pop culture can shatter into a million different (interesting) microcultures, then Joel Ivany wants to know why can’t opera get smaller, without sacrificing any of its gorgeous sound and thunderous emotion?\" \n\nIt's a good question. Some of the most awestruck feedback I've gotten from people raving about opera singers has been after gigs that I considered \"no big deal\" in scale: cocktail parties, school tours, flashmobs, impromptu aria nights at restaurants with pianos in them. Singing really is something to admire, and we all agree that scaling down will never mean sacrificing great voices.\n\nIt's worth considering that watching live theatre at a large distance might not be much different from what those same audiences can get from a big-screen TV. We can watch the BBC Proms, catch the HD broadcasts from the Met, and cheer for Renée at the Superbowl without having to be physically there.&nbsp;A grand theatre with a large distance between audience and performer is almost on par in affect with these televised options. The spectacle that's left to offer (and was offered first, to be clear) is proximity. &nbsp;It satisfies what people really all have in common: curiosity.\n\nIs she&nbsp;really making that sound with no microphone? Look at her breathe! She literally expands! Wow, look at that sweat. It must be so hard to do that!\n\nThe impression that great singers make in close quarters can't be replicated. Audience members can *see* the work, the skill that goes into a singer's craft. They can even see the glances a singer may give towards a conductor (be they panicked glances or not), giving them a first-hand look at how this art is pulled off.\n\nHuman curiosity should be to opera companies what human insecurity is to the beauty product industry. We all want to snoop, take behind-the-scenes tours, figure out how that magician created that cool illusion. Hell, even I often prefer to watch a show from backstage. It's special, and unique. Paring down opera to a black box scale, or at least out of the expensive theatre may seem like a cheap Plan B, but you'll never lose an audience by placing them smack dab in the middle of the art. Why separate when you can combine? Why go broke over grandeur? And what a way to demand top-notch creativity from the artists? With no place to hide, you're left with honesty. Humans love that, even in their imaginary worlds.",

        "body": "We're nearing the end of Summer Program Season, people. As a veteran of SPs myself, I always wonder about the young folks that went to [OperaNUOVA](http://www.operanuova.ca/) or [COSI](http://www.co-si.com/) or [COAA](http://www.music.uwo.ca/students/non_degree/academies/coaa_aedo.html#coaa)[/AEDO](http://www.music.uwo.ca/students/non_degree/academies/coaa_aedo.html#aedo) or the [Halifax Summer Opera Festival](http://halifaxsummeroperafestival.com/) or [St. Andrews-by-the-Sea](http://www.standrewsartscouncil.nb.ca/opera.htm) or any of those Canadian summer staples. I wonder which of the singers had one of those \"aha!\" lessons with a new teacher, or performed their first major role in an opera, or found out they were really into Alexander Technique. I wonder about the pianists who might have worked on their very first opera, and if they got along with their conductor and learned the art of turning ten fingers into an orchestra. I wonder if they realized that not all singers are stupid, that some of them are downright awesome.\n\nI remember spending the summer of 2007 high on music. I went to OperaNUOVA, and then to the Banff Centre's Opera as Theatre Program, and I just couldn't get enough. I sat in plenty of voice lessons that eventually gave me the building blocks to becoming a vocal coach. I failed miserably at following a conductor's artful _rubato_, and mentally flogged myself for not being able to read maestro's mind. I played in acting coachings and learned what happens to a singer's voice when they finally figure out their dramatic intent. I watched endless masterclasses, noting how Michael McMahon or Martin Katz or Martin Isepp were able to hone in on a singer's technical issue and work with them to produce marked results within their 20-30min time slot.\n\nI wonder if the opera newbies have gotten a taste of the difficult, beautiful phenomenon of meeting friends and colleauges in this industry. They've realized that this huge love of opera and music is shared by the people around them, and that it brings people together like glue. The days and nights in rehearsal, perhaps living communally, sharing meals and drinks in the same few spots again and again, all result in inside jokes that would make an outsider's eyes roll, and bonds that really do last forever. Their colleagues have probably become their great friends, and they'll continue to miss each other and catch right back up the next time their opera paths cross. The missing of friends and the fast collecting of new ones will be a constant if these SP-goers decide to continue their life in opera, and it's simply one more thing to learn, and learn to love.\n\nSummer programs are concentrated chunks of time where everything is sped up. The meeting of new people is almost forced, and there's nothing better at breaking down walls than those terrifying acting classes, early morning yoga sessions or spending weeks together in a show. Also, group excursions to the water park in West Ed Mall will do the trick. Lessons with new teachers and coaches come with much anticipation, and when both student and teacher exist in a new, neutral environment (one that is simply \"away\"), the work tends to get beautifully distilled into moments of lightbulbs and high fives.\n\nSo, I wonder who has recently gotten high on opera this summer. I wonder if someone's first trip to Italy has changed them, or if they've sat in their very first, honest-to-goodness _sitzprobe_ with an honest-to-goodness orchestra. I wonder if they've been inspired by their newfound colleagues, or learned a new warm-up, or managed to sit in lotus position. I wonder if they discovered La Rotonda, or the Sugar Bowl, or lobster, or the ocean. My memories from those first few exhaustingly inspiring years are littered with Hudson's, magpies, mosquitoes, Tender Times, Seattle's Best, mountains, green figs, grappa, and of course endless sheets of music. I know I'm not old enough for this all to have changed too much, and it thrills me to think of how many full hearts have traveled home with a new love for this business.\n\nIf you're one of these cheesy folks I'm talking about, tell me all about it in the comments below.",

        "body": "Alaina Viau is the Artistic Director of [LooseTEA Music Theatre](http://looseteamusictheatre.com/). She's hard at work with the creative team of LooseTEA's upcoming double-bill, _Love in the Age of AutoCorrect_. The double-bill includes present-day adaptations of Mozart's _Bastien und Bastienne_ and Stravinsky's _Mavra_. Because this opera world is small, it's no surprise that Alaina happens to be working on this project with so with my friend and [frequent Schmopera-contributor](http://schmopera.com/author/greg/) Gregory Finney. I asked Alaina a few questions about presenting two operas in updated forms and why we should keep doing so; Greg was kind enough to chime in with some of his own answers. Love in the Age of AutoCorrect runs August 21-23 at Atelier Rosemarie Umetsu. [Get details and tickets here](http://looseteamusictheatre.com/current-productionautocorrect-operas/).\n\n### 1\\. What about _Bastien und Bastienne_ and _Mavra_ make these operas adaptable to present-day?\n\n**Alaina**: _Bastien und Bastienne_ was written 250 years ago and we are still having the same arguments in the same way about the same issues as we do today! This piece is in the vein as a sitcom argument from the likes of _Friends_ or _Sex in the City_. We think in 2014 that we are more evolved than people who lived back in the 1700s, and the truth is, we still think exactly the same way with the same feelings. So it was very easy to put it in a modern setting. _Mavra_ is also similar to a bad (or good?) soap opera with exaggerated life circumstances, decisions and reactions. Making the change in characters (from female to male) has made it much easier to put the opera into a context to which people in the 21st century people will be able to connect. However, the situation described in the opera is still completely relatable. I have had it quite easy this time through in finding the common thread between the setting of the opera and our life today; seems as though we haven’t changed all that much!\n\n**Greg**: It's the age-old plight of awkwardness and screwing up in the first stage of a relationship and I can say that it's relevant because a vaguely similar situation literally happened to me about 2 months ago. Lines crossed, miscommunication over the internet/SMS lead to a whole mess of confusing incidents.\n\nIt also updates the classic operatic motif of \"the missing letter\" or \"the intercepted letter\" or \"the insert-descriptor-here letter\". It's almost always a letter. We don't write those anymore, it's all texts, Facebooks, Tweets and emails.\n\n### 2\\. What can audiences expect from LooseTEA’s upcoming double-bill?\n\n**Alaina**: The show is outside on the lovely terrace at [Atelier Rosemarie Umetsu](http://atelierrosemarieumetsu.com/home) which is going to make this a very fun and hilarious night! We are very lucky to have some great beverage sponsors so now our audience can enjoy amazing music and sip the best wine that Niagara has to offer in the evening on a patio! If the weather is uncooperative, our audience can rest easy that we have designed a canopy that can be deployed! Lastly, the audience can expect an opera that will get them thinking about our modern day lives and how important communication is, and how funny or tragic situations can become when communication is lost. Additionally, it is our goal for the audience to think about today’s world of hyper-connectivity and mass communication, and how it is even more easy to miscommunicate than ever before. We really want our audience to engage with the show, by making noise if they want to, by texting, and Tweeting, remarking to their neighbour. We only hope for people to enjoy themselves!\n\n**Greg**: An intimate venue and a focus on storytelling. Everyone in the cast is a great singer and that's kind of the assumption I make about opera, is that the cast will be good singers. This crew though, great actors too. Lots of fun playing back and forth, and as the show continues to find its feet, we're seeing some really great moments happen. The houses for this one are quite small, so it will have almost an exclusive, private vibe for a very inclusive, affordable public performance.\n\n### 3\\. In Mavra, why did you choose to change the traditionally female roles of the Mother and the Neighbour, casting them for baritone (the Parent) and tenor?\n\n**Alaina**: Initially I was going to try casting the females as females; however I was very aware that I might have difficulty finding a Stravinsky mezzo and contralto with my limited budget. As I got more into writing the adaptation I started to get annoyed with the mother character; She just did not seem to make that much sense to the story. Since I was adapting it anyways I started to play with the idea of them being men and having it be a single parent dynamic. It has turned out to work brilliantly and in my opinion, better than the original (Shhhh, don’t tell Stravinsky that). In the context of having a secret lover, I like the father-daughter relationship better than that of a mother. Especially since the father is a single parent and is away often for business, it would make sense that Parasha would have a secret lover more so than with a stay at home mother. It also makes for some really funny moments that could not be there in the original setting. \n\n### 4\\. LooseTEA Music Theatre is all about exploring the new. What is your creative process in doing so, from choosing a piece to putting it on its feet?\n\n**Alaina**: As a director, I pay attention to the world around me a lot; people watching, conversations, watching reactions, body language, current and old news, books (so many books), nature, and many, many shows/concerts of all types. I listen to people and their stories and also take a lot of time to self-reflect on situations, reactions and other outcomes. All of this observation gets thrown into a huge pot in my head. In general, I put a directive like “I love Beethoven’s Symphony no. 5, but what can I do with it that will reflect how I feel about it?” into my brain and set it to percolate. It seems to be reflected unconsciously in my observations and experiences and after not too long an idea pops up unexpectedly. I start to play with the image consciously reflecting it in my everyday life. Of course there are always external things that change the course of the original idea like budget, the space, your singers and then creative ideas are found that will still resonate with the concept.\n\nWhen I start to look for a piece I pick out a whole range of pieces and start to imagine how that world would look like if it was a situation within modern memory. For this show I was looking for shorter pieces to do a double bill so I researched and decided on a few that I liked the best. On a long weekend where I was sick in bed, I listened and imagined new stories to all of them. I loved _Mavra_ from the get go and sought out to find something to present it with. Luckily the Stravinsky was written during his Neo-classical period and fit very well musically with the Mozart. And they are both comedies. It was pretty much decided at that point. I looked at the main issues within each opera and found that they were both about miscommunication which in the 21st century leads very naturally to how we miscommunicate through our devices. I was sold! I decided it all in that weekend and even came up with the name “Love in the Age of Autocorrect”.\n\n### 5\\. How do your roles within the opera and classical music industries complement each other as Artistic Director of LooseTEA?\n\n**Alaina**: Artistically, I have access to many creative people and endeavours, which allows me to take in many different opinions and views. They are generally supportive about my ambitions and are very willing to have conversations and discussions about their work. My best education has been working at the ROH Covent Garden. Just before leaving to return to Canada I sat down with the Director of Opera and talked about the problems, difficulties and strategies for many classical music “issues” from ticket prices to choosing a season and the problem about being stuck in a building. I was just starting to form my idea about LooseTEA and that conversation still sticks with me. It was also seeing every production, over and over with different singers and dancers. It got to the point that if I didn’t see anything for a week I would feel like I was going into withdrawal. It was lovely to feel something every day (almost). I really wanted others to feel the same. I developed a great need to share that and help people feel what I felt through classical music. I realized that I wanted to share experiences.\n\nI have also been fortunate for my job at the GGS! It has given me access to a whole network within the industry in Toronto that would have taken me years to develop. With a lot of hard work I have been able to learn what I need to be a successful arts business person from managing large budgets, production/stage management, and the costs of creativity both on stage and in the orchestra. I am not just an Artistic Director but I am an administrator as well. This means I can balance my creativity with the practical and make decisions that are going to be the biggest bang for my buck, so to say!\n\n### 6\\. What sort of evolution has LooseTEA seen from one production to the next?\n\n**Alaina**: We have two very exciting developments this year; the first is that we have a GM!! This has been the most exciting part for LooseTEA/me. It means I don’t have to do everything myself, which was stifling my creativity. I didn’t choose this show until February, so I have not had as much lead time as would be preferred; however having a GM has given the company stability in future planning. We have a very solid 3-5 year plan to expand the scope and number of shows we present. I have productions planned out up to 2017, with partners and partnering artists already being engaged for both operas and staged orchestral works. \n\nIn terms of the actual productions, this year is actually smaller than last year mostly because of the added work of writing an adaptation, which I have never done before. The piece also doesn’t require as much set/costume/lighting as Carmen so we can make it rely more on the acting and comedy. I don’t think that any two works will ever be presented the same. They all require different spaces, and sizes of productions. Each production is being presented in the way best suited to the concept, and to the highest artistic quality that our passion can muster, which naturally means that they should all be different from each other. We also received our Not-for-Profit status and our charitable application has been sent in. It is all starting to feel legit! \n\n### 7\\. Do you have any bucket-list shows you’d like to present in the future?\n\n**Alaina**: Haha! So many! This past spring I have had an out pouring of creativity as my GM and I work toward our 3 -5 year plan. I have been finding it funny that I have chosen some pieces that I like and others that I usually would not care much for. For example, I didn’t really care much for _Carmen_ in the past because I had so many issues with it. When I can change/adapt and reconstruct my idea of a piece then that is when it really starts to grab me by the collar! Because of that I don’t particularly have a bucket list, but I can give you a sneak peek into what I’m working on for the future: _Faust_, _Adieu Robert Schumann_, _Don Quichotte_, _Eight Songs for a Mad King_, _La bohème_, Beethoven's symphonies 9 and 5, with a Stravinsky/Gesualdo inspired installation.\n\n**Greg: **SING ALL OF THE SHOWS!! Seriously though my top ones right now are Papageno in _Magic Flute_/Leporello in _Don Giovanni_. I've sung both in concert, but I'd love to get to play around the stage with them. Sweeney in _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_ (this should require no explanation) and Javert in _Les Misérables_.\n\nGet your tickets for _Love in the Age of AutoCorrect_ [right here](http://looseteamusictheatre.com/buy-tickets/)!

Acting President of the United States Frank Underwood is a terrifying Verdi-baritone, keeping the audience on his side partly with the use of his charming Southern drawl. Frank's wife, Claire, would be a rich contralto pulling the serene wife card when she needed to, and unleashing Clytemnestra-type power when it's more appropriate. The music would be an eerie mix of _Nixon in China_ and _The Rape of Lucretia_. Maybe a bit of _Lulu_-reminiscence in Claire's music. And of course, a grumbling, wise bass would sing the role of Freddy Hayes, the guy with the great rib joint.\n\n### 2. _The Walking Dead_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429239541496/TWD.jpeg)\n</figure>\n\nOh, it could be so great. Rick would be a Don José-type of tenor, with lots of meaningful, soaring lines to sing, which carrying an ever-growing load of inner _Sturm und Drang_. Maybe a zombie _leitmotif_: something with lots of sagging trombones mixed with string harmonics. Super eery, totally unmistakable, very Philip Glass-meets-Penderecki. You could have zombie chorus members coming through the audience, shuffling painfully down the aisles. Or even have a few planted supers in the audience that turn into walkers somewhere during Act 2\\. Nightmares for weeks.\n\n### 3. _Mad Men_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429239554767/Don-Draper.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nHow amazing would Don Draper be as an opera hero? A cocky high baritone, singing apathetically between puffs of his cigarette. Roger Sterling would be a snarling bass-baritone, always the bad influence, and unpacking some extra layers of humanity near the end of Act 3 after a particularly depressing night of drinking. Oh, and the _women_ would be so good. Think of all the types of secretly strong women in that cast. You could get sopranos Betty Draper and Peggy Olson with lush mezzo Joan Harris singing gorgeous trios about being mistreated by men. Mad, mad men. Very _Peter Grimes_, if he were American.\n\n### 4. _Orange is the New Black_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429239633169/OITNB.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nNow this would be like _Dialogues des Carmélites_, just without the big political cause and less obedience. I picture Red like a Grand Prioress, played by basically Judith Forst. Vee could be an evil twist on Madame Lidoine. Piper would of course be a soubrette, with her mezzo ex-girlfriend, Alex. Plenty of pep-talk arias for big-haired Nicky and Bible-thumping from born-ahead-meth-head Tiffany. Oh, and Uzo Aduba could come and reprise the operatic version of Crazy Eyes, _because [she's a real singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2mcwfcXW50)!_\n\n### 5. _The Big Bang Theory_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429239597149/BBT.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nWe could be looking at a new source for stock characters here. All the kinds of nerds. Sheldon would be a Peter Pears-type tenor, like Albert Herring but self-content. He and his baritone buddies Raj and Howard, and Rossini-tenor Leonard, could make up the new _La bohème _foursome of the 21st-century. Penny is of course a soubrette-ish soprano (very Despina), and Amy is a hopeless mezzo. Also, who better to cast as today's bubbliest coloratura soprano than blonde, buxom Bernadette?\n\n### 6. _Game of Thrones_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\"\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429239648243/GOT.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nThe _Games of Thrones_ opera would no doubt be a stage manager's absolute nightmare. Think of all the people to manage, the fight rehearsals, the animals onstage, the snow cues. You'd really need a rotating stage. The bows would take _forever_. But also, think of a Medieval _Ring Cycle_, with a _leitmotif_ for all seven kingdoms, including _dragon music_. There could be virile tenors singing Jon Snow, and Daenerys could be a dramatic coloratura with shrieks that could break glass. You know, because she's the mother of dragons. Tyrion would obviously be a booming bass, and Arya could become the next coveted sometimes-pants-role. You could actually cast a countertenor to sing the eunuch, but it would be much better suited to Joffrey.\n\nDid I miss any? Let me know in the comments below!",

[Opera in the City](http://files.rc.mu/RoyalConservatorySchool/2014/Jul30/NEWMusicAppreciationClasses_3.html) is a new Music Appreciation Class at the RCM, and it focuses on Handel's _Alcina_ (opening at [Opera Atelier](http://www.operaatelier.com/season/14-15-season/) October 23rd), Verdi's _Falstaff,_ and Puccini's _Madama Butterfly_ (both at the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season.aspx)beginning in October). Leading the new course is Eric Domville, Professor Emeritus of English literature at the University of Toronto, writer and lecturer on opera and song, and frequent speaker at Opera Atelier's and the COC's pre-show talks. I had the pleasure of working with him on a concert that was all about the Brothers Grimm, and he's a fascinating guy. The [course](http://files.rc.mu/RoyalConservatorySchool/2014/Jul30/NEWMusicAppreciationClasses_3.html) runs Tuesday afternoons, September 9th-October 14th.\n\nYou can also head to more class and prep for the rest of the seasons from the Canadian Opera Company and Opera Atelier; the winter course (January 6-27) covers Mozart's _Don Giovanni_ and Wagner's _Die Walküre_, and the spring course (March 24-April 28) will be focus on Gluck's _Orpheus and Eurydice_, Rossini's _Il barbiere di Siviglia_, Schoenberg's _Erwartung_ and Bartòk's _Bluebeard's Castle_.\n\nSo, if you're in the mood for honing your opera chops before you head off to the show, this is a fantastic way to do it. You'll also get a chance to hear live performances by students of the Glenn Gould School, and there's even coffee and goodies from [b espresso bar](http://bespressobar.ca/). Tuition is $295, which is a steal to hear Eric Domville speak on these juicy operas.

I gave it a try: I searched for \"Papageno\", and got a list back that includes the Count, Harlekin, Falke and Mercutio.

I, as audition pianist, will search for appropriate roles based on the singer's starting aria, and I will show this web-generated list to the panel of auditioners in order to settle their _fach_-ing disputes.

        "body": "Earlier this summer I was listening to the brilliant Graham Forst (husband of the formidable Judith Forst) give a talk on the history of the Don Juan character. He was talking about how Don Juan comes from the concept of Dionysus or Bacchus, these figures of indulgences that sound so fun. Graham was trying to get a feel from the room about what we thought of the character of Don Juan; the answer is strongly. We feel strongly about Don Juan, whether we're disgusted by or jealous of him. It got me thinking about the notion of a female Don Juan, and whether or not Carmen was the best equivalent. But she's really not. Her seducing of important men (soldier, bullfighter) is out of a motivation to get more power, or more freedom, and she may even have accidentally fallen in love with Don José along the way. Don Juan already has status and a good amount of power and freedom; his seductions of women are compulsive, immediately self-serving, and they definitely don't linger in his mind afterwards (if he can help it). It struck me that the idea of sexual conquest generally means a man convinced a woman to sleep with him. It's not the same \"chase\" from woman to man; Carmen, in order to become a Doña Juan, wouldn't really have to do much, and she'd sadly get shoved out of society for being a harlot faster than anyone could admire her determination.\n\nSo that's a semi-serious precursor to where my mind went after pondering Don Juan and his ally, Carmen. I started thinking about how _mental_ some opera plots would be if their characters' genders were reversed. Like, how pathetic would _The Bartered Groom_ be? Or how about a super weird male Manon? Since this is, after all, the supposed \"age of the director\", here are a few examples that make me curious to see these switcheroo versions on stage:\n\n### 1. _Tosca_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429238276639/tosca3.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nRome's most celebrated tenor, Tosco, has a girlfriend who paints (and who sometimes helps her friends escape prison), Maria. The powerful (yet lonely) police chief, Madama Scarpietta, comes by to blackmail the tenor (she's secretly in love with him and hates his activist girlfriend), telling him she'll torture his girlfriend unless he agrees to marry Scarpietta instead. It's still pretty dark, eh? Although when Scarpietta comes to force herself upon Tosco, it could be hard to sell the gravity of that scene to the point of Tosco stabbing a lady. Unless Scarpietta is very [Kathleen Turner in _Californication_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFNpSlqX6ZA). \n\n### 2. _Der Rosenkavalier_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429238344346/JoyceRosenkav.png)\n</figure>\n\nI suppose this one could still work. Octavian becomes Octavia, a young socialite lady, torn between her passionate affair with an older man, and this hot young guy that she's supposed to marry (he turns out to be really funny). The arranged marriage portion of the story wouldn't be so odd, with a woman caught in the middle of it all. The opening scene with Octavia and her older lover might come across a little suspicious (\"Wie du warst\", are you _sure_?), but the idea of a young woman leaving an older man for a younger one might even be more sad than _Rosenkav: the Original_.\n\n### 3. _La traviata_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429238494695/Traviata.png)\n</figure>\n\nA high-class male escort (_Il traviato_) has a clingy (and wealthy) female client, and he ends up falling for her. They run off to the country and have a great time until the female client's crazy mother comes with her Bible and her guilt trip. The mother shames the male escort for corrupting her good little daughter, and convinces him to leave her. Meanwhile, male escort has health problems, and his favourite client runs back into his arms just in time to see him succumb. The mother kind of feels bad. See, this story is _so sad _no matter what.\n\n### 4. _Così fan tutte_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429238524857/Cosi.png)\n</figure>\n\nTwo girls are hideously insecure about their relationships with their boyfriends, so they set them up and try to catch them cheating. It's very Cameron-Diaz-and-Christina-Applegate-in-_The-Sweetest-Thing_. Very Romy and Michele. And I hope their boyfriends _do _cheat; these guys deserve girls who aren't insecure messes, even if they are Albanians.\n\n### 5. _Madama Butterfly_\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429238551230/ButterflyHairPicks.png)\n</figure>\n\nEntitled American tourist Miss Pinkerton sails over to Japan for kicks, finds herself a hot Japanese guy (budding sumo wrestler, to cling to the stereotype?) to hang out with, gets pregnant by him and takes off. She comes back three years later with her new American husband, demanding child-support payments from Signore Butterfly. That woman would be just as horrible as Pinkerton himself; the idea of a lonely man, estranged from his son by his awful baby-mama is just so pathetically _sad_. Puccini, eh?\n\n### Runners Up:\n\n Let's not neglect the heartbreak that could come from an Ugly Betty-type _Alberta Herring_, with her pretty best friend who's dating the guy Alberta likes. _Le nozze di Figaro_ would oddly be creepier than it is already, with a psycho lady of the house who has this weird thing where she _has to _sleep with all her male staff. The psycho house-mistress also has an emasculated husband, who gets either neglected or treated like dirty. And _Lulu_. If Lulu were some lithe, destructive dude, he would be at best a skewed version of Don Juan, and at worst, a gay attention whore.\n\nOperatic shower thoughts on this Friday morning.",

That's right, after waving branches to make herself look bigger, the mountain lion wasn't fazed; and so she went for louder. \"I just started singing opera really loud,\" said Kyra.\n\nI think the question we all want to know is: what did she sing?? My first guess was instinctively something from one of the Valkyries, or maybe the Queen of the Night. Wouldn't it have been amazing, though, if she broke out into the Doll Song in front of a mountain lion? Or \"Va! laissez couler mes larmes!\", all _Werther_-dramatic in the woods. Or even \"Je veux vivre\" because that's funny. I'm also well aware that it's a good chance that Kyra just sang some loud, opera-ish notes and didn't actually break out into aria. But these are the things that I think about when I read the news.\n\nSee, this is why I felt safe in Banff. Apparently a safe way to hike is doing it while surrounded by opera singers.",

Rufus has yet to find a financial backer for the project, so he has turned to crowdfunding to find the cash on his own. He has set up the _Prima Donna_ project on [Pledge Music](http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/primadonna), stating, \"It is vitally important to me that 'Prima Donna' be properly recorded and released so that I can tour a concert version of it in the coming year.\" He mentions his opera's short-yet-turbulent performance history, including the \"sold out shows in London and Toronto\" and the \"early rocky days with the Metropolitan Opera,\" and states that _Prima Donna_ \"is a solid and viable offering that both people love performing in and audiences enjoy watching and listening to. It’s vitally important we get a quality recording for generations to come.\"\nIn what seems like an odd choice, Rufus is also offering up a few [incentives](http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/primadonna) for bigger spenders. He's selling stuff like outfits that he wore onstage or on album covers, one of seven conductor's batons from the _Prima Donna_ recording, £1500, and you can even buy a spot in the \"glorious choir\" that will back up Rufus as he sings his famous anthem, \"Hallelujah\". The catch with that one is that the concerts are in Australia and it doesn't look like travel is included in the ~$100 price.\n\nSomething about this feels fishy. I can't think of anything objectively offensive about Rufus Wainwright reaching out to his fan base in order to fund one of his projects. But, like, the _clothes_, and the \"I want to do a tour version\" reasoning; I can't shake the feeling that Rufus is into writing opera for the wrong reasons. I suppose there isn't one answer to the question of why one should or shouldn't write an opera, but there are a lot of things about Rufus' relationship with opera that make me think he's in it for the glamour. For the fabulousness. He has said, \"I think in our modern world, among younger audiences especially, there's a hunger for a sort of spectacle that the opera world thinks is no longer relevant.\" That whole \"spectacle\" idea is what's skewed with Rufus, in my opinion; the whole thing about insisting _Prima Donna_ would be sung in French (more glamourous that way, I suppose), how he showed up to the Manchester premiere _dressed as Verdi_, and now Rufus' selling little tastes of glamour via a crowdfunding campaign; it all smells of high art, all dolled up without knowing exactly why. And it feels a bit disrespectful. That spectacle is there in opera because the stories and the characters warrant it; I wonder sometimes if Rufus truly understands that, that it's not glamour making drama, but the other way around.\n\nI mean, it doesn't take much to notice that Rufus Wainwright fancies himself a bit of an aesthete. And I suppose even Verdi knew he was writing hits at the time. But they were never hits for their own sake. Rufus writes, \"Exciting rehearsals, deep conversations, strange and colorful characters, not to mention many a silly moment, all of this I’m truly excited to experience with you until that glorious moment when the conductor, myself the composer, the orchestra, the singers and the recording crew turn on the red light and put down for posterity my first magnum opus, 'Prima Donna.'\" I figure that this _Prima Donna_ recording and his future operatic endeavours (including his upcoming COC commission, _Hadrian_), will remain not about opera, or even _this_ opera, but about Rufus.\n\nTo judge for yourself, visit the _Prima Donna_ Pledge Music page[ right here](http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/primadonna).",

Even better, the budding operaphile is reaching out via [r/opera](http://www.reddit.com/r/opera/), asking how to get a proper introduction to opera. His post is titled, [\"Help a noob expand his opera horizons\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/opera/comments/2d917h/help_a_noob_expand_his_opera_horizons/), and he asks,\n\n> \"The only operatic piece I really know is Nessun Dorma as performed by Pavarotti. But that last note give me chills! Is other opera like that or have I discovered the pinnacle already? Suggest some pieces for me to explore that will thrill me!\"\n\n It's one of the top posts in r/opera, probably because it's just the kind of question that opera-lovers want to answer; it means they get to comment with their own personal summary of opera's history, their recommended \"next steps\" from the Opera Noob's original discovery of \"Nessun Dorma\", and how to get the most out of his live opera experiences to come. (Go, be opera nerds and [add your two cents](http://np.reddit.com/r/opera/comments/2d917h/help_a_noob_expand_his_opera_horizons/)!) The Noob got some decent advice, about maybe catching a performance of _Turandot_ to see if he's into opera for the long haul, not just the high notes. A few commenters told him to go see Mozart right away, because his operas are funny. A mini-discussion broke out about surtitles; one commenter didn't know surtitles existed until this week, and agreed that they were a great idea. There are small disagreements over whether or not Wagner is a good choice, and someone links to [this version of the Ring Cycle that lasts less than 3 minutes](http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/video/2013/sep/18/wagners-ring-cycle-2-mins-video) (It's still confusing).

        "body": "A while back, [I got impatient](/opera-memes-a-deconstruction/) with a bunch of opera memes that were circulating around the Internet. It has happened again, partly thanks to the[ Opera Memes Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OperaSingerMemes). Here we go, for Act II of the Opera Memes Deconstruction:\n\n### 1\\. The non-sequitur buzzword-gripe meme:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429236360206/Repo-Opera.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nFirstly, I had to Google _Repo! The Genetic Opera_. It's a horror-musical-film-rock-opera hybrid mutant, and it apparently holds a record for most amount of musical numbers in one piece. [It's got 73](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo!_The_Genetic_Opera), as per the above meme, and I'm not sure what that has to do with the general public's innocent ignorance towards opera. Nonetheless, this meme is here to make sure that you know that opera is not related to some musical-film-deal with 73 songs in it. It's no mash-up of stylistic genres, held together with a dramatic plot and almost constant music. No sir, opera is certainly not drama with music in it. No Siree Bob. (To be fair: it's probably _not_ like _Repo!_, but this feels like innocent small-talk between an opera person and a non-opera person, taken too seriously by the former.)\n\nAlso, why is it an angry-looking ostrich? Emu? Birds have less to do with opera than _Repo! The Genetic Opera_.\n\n### 2\\. The Captain Obvious Meme:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429236462548/Chan.png)\n</figure>\n\nYay. You noticed a hole in an opera plot. It's true, they're all over the place; _Il trovatore_ has that whole \"I burned the wrong baby\" thing, and Leporello and Don Giovanni manage to fool a decent number of people with their shenanigans. Hell, there's freaking _Fidelio_. Now, frustrated, Jackie Chan-inspired operagoer, go get yourself some tickets to _La traviata_ or some opera version of Shakespeare (Britten will suffice) and get yourself some satisfying-plot-points. I won't say this meme doesn't have a point, but it's sort of the operatic equivalent of discovering that popcorn is expensive at the movies. \n\n### 3\\. The Equally-As-Annoying Neighbour Meme:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429236496094/BlastDG.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nThis guy. This guy has neighbours who add small doses of comfort and happiness to their dwelling in the form of artsy knick-knacks, colourful interior paint jobs and their choice of music coming from their apparently powerful home-audio setup. I assume by \"crappy music\", this guy's neighbours are _not_ blasting obscure Meyerbeer or that song by John Cage that takes 600 years to play (entitled _A[s Slow as Possible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Slow_as_Possible)_, for clarity). These hoodlums are no doubt blasting some hippety-hop, or maybe something by aliens Katy Perry or Lady Gaga, or maybe it's even a combination of both, like this annoyingly infectious[ Pharrell song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM). But it is no doubt _crappy music_, and balance must be restored by blasting dem beats by Mozart instead. Oh, those moments of _crescendo_ and _sforzando_ chords blasting away sure are _epic_, if you can stand the wait between loud bits on the poorly-equalized audio playback of your live recording of _Don Giovanni_ with Giulini in it. You, sir, have _told them_. You probably put the last 30 seconds of the Commendatore scene on repeat.\n\n### 4\\. The About-Me Meme Trilogy:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429236678539/opera-singers-e40c9e856b669d06aec5c07dcd76d2.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nThis one is interesting; I've found a few versions of this multi-meme, all trying to clarify what exactly an opera singer does all day long. Let's look at the first one to get our bearings: so, most people think you're a horned lady screaming, except your mom and friends, who think you're playing around and being in _Phantom_. Other singers think you're a snob, and maybe it's because you think you're onstage all the time singing, but instead you're just a tea expert. Next.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429236728465/opera-singer-f4b1ba0d9c00df5dbc798e417ce3db.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nAgain with the societal concept of the Valkyries, and the parents not taking your job seriously. Here, your friends at least know you're not in a constant Andrew Lloyd Webber scene, but there's the added complication of your significant other being jealous of your onstage romances. Again, you seem to think you're the main character whenever you're onstage, but you've grown comfortable admitting that you still indeed practice.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429236772065/opera-singer-student-72c731a17068705b123b5b2858042f.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nFinally, we've got the humble student version of this Me-Meme. Apparently here your friends are now the problem, making mental associations between you and that crazy, obese, horned lady again. Your mother is very proud of you and knows you are the next Callas. Society doesn't know much about opera, but at least they think you're in the same league as that surprisingly-not-fat opera-type singer who was on the BBC Proms. You are insinuating that you lie to your teachers when you tell them you practice, and that's problematic because you are under the impression that you are sharing duets with Jonas Kaufmann a lot. But I finally have to give props for honesty at the end. Opera binges on YouTube. Ah, 2008\\. [This was my jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tImMZLfHaE).\n\n### 5\\. One Last Meme That's Actually Kind Of Funny:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429236807441/TamarMeme.jpg)\n\nYou remember [Tamar Iveri](http://schmopera.com/desdemona-down), right? She's the Georgian soprano that got in some trouble over a more-than-a-little homophobic statement she made on her Facebook page. I love the idea of a calculated, well-timed system of propaganda; how operatic. Although it could have been played out better if they hadn't ended up firing Tamar from the Opera Australia production of _Otello_. Think of the marketing campaign: \"Come one, come all (except if you're gay) and cheer as our homophobic soprano sings music from the West she hates so much!\" It would be a show, no doubt. Anyway, I like the idea of this meme's Keanu-Reeves-inspired character thinking about the opera industry's struggles to stay relevant in this modern age. That's funny to me.\n\nDo you have your favourite opera memes? Share them in the comments below!",

        "body": "### 1. After _La bohème_: Schaunard\n\n After Mimì dies, the four guys' vibe has changed, and all the bright-side-of-life way of thinking that held them together no longer works. Schaunard decides to follow his singing career, and it takes him to the cabaret. He becomes wildly famous in Paris, and he meets a fellow cabaret singer there, and they have a fiery affair that makes Marcello and Musetta look like Tamino and Pamina. \n \n### 2. After _Die Fledermaus_: Prince Orlofsky\n\n We only met him at one of his infamous parties, and didn't have the chance to see that the Prince has become a sad man, kept amused only with his huge fortune. He struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, and distracts himself in a very Great Gatsby sort of way from his own life. Perhaps he was abandoned as a child, or forced to go to law school when he really just wanted to sing. The Prince had broken the hearts of a few groupies-turned-lovers, until he saw Adele show up at one of his latest parties. He can't get her out of his head, and he's going to find her, Cinderella-style.\n \n### 3. After _Don Giovanni_: Donna Elvira\n\n It could be very _Dialogues des Carmélites_, very _Orange is the New Black_. Elvira told us all that she'd quit it with men and go live in a convent. She'd meet other nuns, some of the friendly and some of them not; some of the nuns might be suspicious of this new addition, thinking that she's just going through a post-breakup-church-phase. Elvira would have to prove herself genuine, perhaps finding her true self along the way amongst these well-behaved ladies. Maybe it could be very _Sister Act_.\n \n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429216951043/Sister-Act-3871-4f028fb2760ee37c4a00394f-1325735617.jpg)\n</figure>\n\n### 4. After _Lucia di Lammermoor_: Enrico\n\n I like to think that Enrico shows us his remorseful side at the end of _Lucia_; so maybe after his sister goes nuts and he realizes that money and status aren't worth lives, he goes to work for underprivileged young women. He gives them a safe place to stay, and teaches them to read and write so that they have a chance at being independent. He donates money to mental health hospitals. He finds that giving back to society helps with the guilt he bears for what happened to Lucia.\n\n### 5. After _Gianni Schicchi_: the Donati family\n\nAfter they all get thrown out of the house for being generally terrible people, the Donatis band together using the skill they all have in common: singing. The family of singers travels around, singing in 8-part harmony like the Andrews Sisters or the von Trapps. They become a Florentine sensation and the family gets back on its feet in no time. A few of the cousins start to question their money-hungry ways, and conflict amongst the Donatis ensues; cue the slapstick comedy and moments of profound lines from the most unexpected characters. Just as entertaining would be to scrap the singing idea and just set them as an operatic version of _The Royal Tenenbaums_. \n\nWhat other opera spin-offs should there be?

        "body": "###Rossini\n\nRossini is fun, light, and can move like the wind. It can be almost laughably simple at times, if not utterly sight-readable. But out of nowhere, it can go from harmless \"ta-da!\" chords and cute little _oom-pahs_ to an endless sea of repeated notes that spell out hell on earth.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429223862747/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-16%20at%206.37.02%20PM.png)\n</figure>\n\n\"Io sono docile\"? More like io sono freaking out. Every time I play this aria I am _convinced_ I've gotten off to an alright start, putting the right finger down on that first E-natural. And then it all goes awry, and by the time I'm asked to repeat five F-sharps in some semblance of a rhythmic pattern, I've decided I can no longer play the piano. It's an added kick-when-the-pianist-is-down to hear that first orchestra rehearsal of the blasted Rossini opera, and to listen to the violins effortlessly play those inevitable repeated-note passages with a few gentle swishes of their bows. It always sounds great, and you finally learn why Rossini crescendos are so fun. But until that moment, you can count on the pianist sitting on the bench in quiet concentration, their thoughts split between trying to find that perfect fingering pattern that will fix their lives and vowing never to take another Rossini gig again.\n\n### Verdi\n\n Verdi is sneaky. You can take a glance at a page from a Verdi score and convince yourself it's sight-readable. Usually some left-handed _oom-pahs_, and a nice tune hanging out in your right hand. The thing is, Verdi is a good orchestrator, and there's plenty of quick changes between groups of instruments; at the piano, these changes mean we jump like schizophrenics between soft and loud, high and low registers. It's like playing whack-a-mole with the keys.\n \nThis bit looks fairly harmless, with plenty of easy chords to spot and no complicated rhythm stuff; but if you're not ready for Verdi's incredible dramatic writing, it's easy to get mowed over by his score that's moving faster than you are . And accuracy counts in Verdi; you can always \"hear through\" his music, and it's never an opaque wash of sound. This means you have to play the notes right, and while there are composers that make this a more difficult task, there are always little Verdi bits like this to ruin your day:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429223981823/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-16%20at%206.39.20%20PM.png)\n</figure>\n\nEvery. Time. Grace notes, I tell you. Coming from above, below, then attached to trills, for Pete's sake. Maybe it's hard for the strings, too. But I tell you, Verdi's tricky; if you're playing Verdi and you're getting comfortable, you're not paying enough attention.\n\n### Puccini\n\n There are two faces of the pianist who plays Puccini. There's the face of the pianist playing the aria from a Puccini show, joyously revelling in the lush harmonies and diatonic scales (albeit with a few too many flats, but give me flats over sharps any day) and having fun with the elastic rhythm and great bass notes. Then there's the face of the pianist playing the stuff _between_ arias in Puccini. It's randomly tricky. I present you the second page of _Tosca_:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429224426117/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-16%20at%206.46.37%20PM.png)\n</figure>\n\nNasty stuff. Chromatic madness and a hidden bar of 3/4 to make sure you're awake. The trade-off is that in every Puccini opera, there's a \"thing\" about the transitional music; in _La bohème_, it's the tiny bits of \"ba-dum-dum-DUM\" interspersed throughout, or in _Madama Butterfly_ it's pentatonic Japan-music. And once you learn the \"thing\", it sort of applies to the whole piece. It's like owning a master key to the opera; if you've got it, it works. The downside is that after the pianist has gone to the trouble of mastering \"ba-dum-dum-DUM\" in every key, everyone is still a little bit just waiting for that music to get us to the next awesome aria; this means the tricky bits of Puccini are technically thankless, but at least those bits are always on their way to playable, loveable lines that will stick in your head _forever_.\n\n### Strauss\n\n With Richard Strauss, you get out of it what you put in. His orchestral writing is really contrapuntal, with plenty of solo lines from different instruments flowing around each other. It can be difficult for a pianist to decide on what to play, since Strauss is similar to Verdi in the way that you can hear all the inner parts that make up the larger whole. It means that pianists have to come to terms with the limits of their ten fingers, and admit that they really can't play all the notes. Even after you've overcome that rudimentary hurdle, Strauss can be fiercely difficult to play. Here's a little bit from a common audition excerpt for opera pianists:\n \n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429224622784/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-16%20at%206.49.50%20PM.png)\n</figure>\n\nUgh, but it's _so good_. This is what I mean by getting out of Strauss what you put in. If I take the time to learn it well (and it takes less time than you'd think), my fingers never forget it. It always surprises me, since Strauss' orchestration is intricate and his orchestras include a lot more players than Rossini's. But there's something extraordinarily _ergonomic_ about even piano reductions of Strauss operas. Maybe wading through his scores demands more of a pianist's brain in the learning stages, and that's why it's more easily retained the next time you're faced with the Composer's Aria or the Presentation of the Rose. It doesn't really matter to me why; Strauss feels like a massage on my hands and arms, and it's _beautiful_ to boot. Yay Strauss.\n\n### ...and finally, Mozart\n\n Mozart is like the _ur-_version of all of the above composers. He writes beautifully for his singers as well as his instruments, meaning that just like in Rossini, the pianist has that problem of orchestral idioms in his vocal score. Mozart's music is an unstopping chameleon of dramatic highs and lows, trading comedy for tragedy and vice versa; like Verdi, if you've not got your wits about you, Mozart can start playing you rather than the other way around. Like Puccini, Mozart's got as many tricky transitions as stunningly beautiful arias, so a pianist's efforts for Antonio's entrance in _Figaro_ will soon be balanced out by stuff like \"Contessa, perdono\". But what keeps me from settling comfortably onto the piano bench when I'm about to play some Mozart is the precision of it all. Notes, phrase endings, even the rhythm that's in Mozart's trills; it's all so much harder than it ever sounds, especially once it's done right. Look at these two bits from _Die Zauberflöte_:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429224916732/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-16%20at%206.54.50%20PM.png)\n</figure>\n\nIf you know the piece, you know this part is _so amazing_. And not overtly hard to play; but, pianists, I _dare you all_ not to whack on the last note they play before the singers come in. Stuff like that is so freaking hard. So is this piece of visual horror for any audition pianist:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429224995865/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-16%20at%206.56.06%20PM.png)\n</figure>\n\nI have a tenor friend who often starts auditions with this aria. I've practiced it too many times to admit, because it's still a crapshoot whether or not I make sure I get my thumb on the right key at the right time or not. Man, C Major sucks. But Mozart is also at the top of that list that I put Strauss in earlier: you get back what you put it, with interest, guaranteed every time.\n\nPianists: what are your fingers' favourite operas to play?

While some singers revel in how beautifully Verdi or Mozart or Strauss wrote for the voice, the pianist is, at that same moment, experiencing how poorly that same music feels under our ten fingers. It's a simple problem, and that's that pianists in the opera world are largely stand-ins for the orchestra. When we play opera, it's for a rehearsal or an audition or some other situation in which we're trying to give someone the general picture of how the music goes, for lack of 80 orchestral players to hire at the time. The pianistic discomfort doesn't even come from the problem of playing from crudely reduced vocal scores, or the fact that we're trying to follow the incoherent flailings of a man with a baton. The music of certain composers has a specific tactile connotation, and it has to do with stuff like the choice of key or the use of specific instrumental idioms. I'll give you some examples:\n",

        "short_description": "For any of those brave pianists who dive into operatic repertoire, there’s an acute awareness of playing music that’s specifically not written for the piano. While some singers revel in how beautifully Verdi or Mozart or Strauss wrote for the voice, the pianist is, at that same moment, experiencing how poorly that same music feels under our ten fingers. It’s a simple problem, and that’s that pianists in the opera world are largely stand-ins for the orchestra. "

        "body": "Last night I went to the opening of [Loose TEA Music Theatre](http://looseteamusictheatre.com/)'s new production, [_Love in the Age of AutoCorrect_](http://looseteamusictheatre.com/current-productionautocorrect-operas/). It was a double bill of updated takes on Stravinsky's [_Mavra_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavra) and Mozart's [_Bastien und Bastienne_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastien_und_Bastienne), this time entitled _Andrew and Andrea_. It was out on the pretty terrace of [Atelier Rosemarie Umetsu](http://atelierrosemarieumetsu.com/home), with a friendly-looking bar to create a beautiful night of outdoor theatre. Rosemarie Umetsu also provided some costume items for the production, in addition to costumes by [Maureen Russell](http://looseteamusictheatre.com/past-productions/production-team/). The double bill is the work of Loose TEA's artistic director, Alaina Viau, and GM, Markus Kopp. She adapted these two short operas into a present-day context, allowing smartphones and Facebook feeds to play central roles in what became a night of social commentary. Alaina conducted the pieces as well, tucked away beside Assistant Music Director and pianist [Jennifer Tung](https://learning.rcmusic.ca/glenn-gould-school/programs-and-faculty/studio-faculty-biographies/jennifer-tung).\n\n_Mavra_ was first on the program, and it reminded me of the cacophony that Stravinsky often creates. It was like [_The Rake's Progress_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rake's_Progress) meets [_Cheryomushki_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow,_Cheryomushki), with bizarre ensembles and cleverly featured outbursts from all the characters. The world of _Mavra_ felt surreal, and Stravinsky's writing for the voice was similar in way's to Britten's conversational style, but everything here was slightly askew. It made for fascinating scenes of idle small talk, or comedy-sized moments of mistaken identity. The two determined lovers were sung by soprano [Morgan Strickland](http://www.morgan-strickland.com/) and tenor Justin Stolz. I thought they sang well together, each with clear and easy sound and promising technique.\n\nMorgan had more than a few tricky-sounding lines and she sang them bravely and easily. Justin filled the space with lots of power and bite to his sound. At times, Justin and Morgan seemed a bit caught up in the difficulties of the piece itself, meaning we got a little less conviction in their text and we lost a bit of their onstage ease. [Keenan Viau](http://www.keenanviau.com/) was chipper and charming as the Neighbour; his background is split between opera and musical theatre, and his presence onstage was something he showed off in this role. Keenan was a recent addition to the _Mavra_ cast, stepping in for tenor Daniel Wheeler, who had to withdraw from the performances due to illness. As the curmudgeonly Parent, baritone [Gregory Finney](http://www.morgan-strickland.com/) (my buddy, and [frequent Schmopera contributor](/author/greg/)) was grumbly and hilariously inconvenienced by the recent death of his maid. I liked his balance between apathy and exaggerated comic tragedy. I'd never heard _Mavra_ before tonight, and it seems like it's a hidden beast to sing. I applaud the cast (and of course, Jennifer at the keys!) for pulling off a serious musical task with this piece.\n\nNext up was _Andrew and Andrea_, the new face of Mozart's one-act about lovers who don't communicate. This was another show I'd never seen before, let alone in its new LooseTEA form; I'm glad that was the case with both of these operas, since I got the chance to see Alaina's adaptations like an eager blank slate. I thought something about _Andrew and Andrea_ clicked for the cast; I definitely got more of everyone's honest side in the Mozart. Morgan Strickland showed her funny side, and I got to really hear her polished singing. While she made Mozart sound easy, I heard her personality, both as a singer and an actor. Keenan had a more central role in this show, and his part let me hear that he has a sweet voice that sits fairly high; he sang with perhaps too much of a musical theatre sound, and I only complain because I think it limited what he could have done with the role. It suited him well, and I liked seeing him act like a gold-digging stud; he even got to throw in a Toronto-friendly \"drunken stupor\" reference that earned its guffaws. As Andrew and Andrea's friend, Mark Zuckerberg (!!), Greg Finney sang warmly and clearly, while playing a double-agent-type between the fighting couple, and while sporting the worst/best pair of jeans I've ever seen. They were so roomy. The closest real-life example I can offer is [this one](http://cdn2.therisinghollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/112749482_p.jpg). He also had a fun moment of being like the Mad Hacker, tapping away on an iPad with creepy excitement in his eyes.\n\nThere's plenty to enjoy in _AutoCorrect_. It's a beautiful outdoor setting, the cast is versatile and entertaining, and you can grab a drink to enjoy before each of the reasonably-timed shows. The translations of both _Mavra_ and _A&A_ were written by Loose TEA's Alaina Viau and Markus Kopp which must have been no small task. Stravinsky tends to feel awkward in several languages, and conversely, Mozart's librettos are intricately tied to the music, making the language a difficult element to alter. The librettos by Alaina included words like \"Facebook status\", \"sext\", and a few F-bombs; it certainly was a new thing for me to hear these words sung by opera singers. There were a few moments in the Mozart where I felt a few rhythmic changes could have better accommodated the English translation; maybe it feels like a crass thing to do, but I feel like Mozart would have been alright that.\n\n_Love in the Age of AutoCorrect_ continues until Sunday afternoon.

The long-time arts critic argues that the social snobbery that clouds opera will never be shed, since those social snobs are the ones funding it all to begin with. \"In order to survive, opera has to prostitute itself to the rich and to people who don't like it, to betray its own essence again and again, to the point where it doesn't even realise it's doing so. The influential part of its audience wants it dead, repetitive, predictable, pretty, safely insulated in some foreign language.\"\n\nThe day after Robert's article came out, his _Guardian_ colleague Tom Service rebutted in his own words, [\"Love opera. Don't fall into the trappings trap\"](http://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2010/may/27/opera-robert-thicknesse-snobbery). \"Opera can only ever be snobbish, elitist, or exclusive if we confuse the bullshit of its social trappings with the blazing beauty of the works we already know and love, and the new operas that are being written today. We mustn't let that happen.\" I get Robert's point though; if the only people supporting opera prefer it as a snobby form of entertainment, we're sort of stuck. In him response, Tom uses the opera version of the No-True-Scotsman argument: opera that is laden with snobbery isn't real opera at all. And maybe Robert is trying to throw the opera baby out with the bathwater.\n\nI agree that opera exists whether or not there are snobs hovering around it; the tricky part is getting this autonomous opera out of the score and on the stage. These articles were written four years ago, a blip in time next to the long history of this conversation-starting art form we love so much. Now, in a concentrated period of opera-company-woes, do you think any of these questions will be addressed? We might not like the answers...",

First to open on October 3rd will be that great last work of Giuseppe Verdi's, _Falstaff_. It's a co-pro with The Royal Opera House (Covent Garden), Teatro alla Scala, the Metropolitan Opera and Dutch National Opera; and because it's by [Robert Carsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Carsen), it means we'll see stark visuals and a stripped-bare style of storytelling. Canadian bass-baritone [Gerald Finley ](https://twitter.com/GeraldFinley)will be in town to sing the title role; I'm personally super curious to hear him as the notoriously comedic Sir John Falstaff, since it's a step in a different direction from his usual offerings of Mozart and John Adams roles. I'm just excited to hear him sing live. Fellow Canadians [Russell Braun](http://www.russellbraun.com/), [Simone Osborne](https://twitter.com/SimoneOsborne), [Marie-Nicole Lemieux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Nicole_Lemieux) and [Lauren Segal](http://www.laurensegal.com/) will join Gerald onstage for what I'm sure will be some spectacular singing from Canada's best. [_Falstaff_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/Falstaff.aspx) will be conducted by the COC's Musical Director, Johannes Debus; it plays for seven performances from October 3rd-November 1st at the Four Seasons Centre in Toronto. [Click here ](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/Falstaff.aspx)for details and tickets.\n\nNext up is the opera experience to end them all, Puccini's [_Madama Butterfly_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/MadamaButterfly.aspx). The production by [Brian Macdonald](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/brian-macdonald/) has its premiere in 1990, and this will be its fifth revival (fun fact: this production was the first one I saw at the Canadian Opera Company, in 2003). This time, two casts take on the twelve performances of _Butterfly_, including [Patricia Racette](http://patriciaracette.com/) in the title role. Patricia has been busy with the role of Madama Butterfly this year, just coming off a run of the show at San Francisco Opera. American soprano [Kelly Kaduce](http://www.barrettvantage.com/artist.php?id=kkaduce) will also sing the role of Butterfly; she's also no stranger to Cio-Cio San, having sung the role in Santa Fe, Portland, and soon, Toronto. Tenors [Stefano Secco](http://www.stefanosecco.com/) and [Andrea Carè](http://www.xn--andreacar-83a.com/) will sing the role of everybody's favourite Puccini villain, Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton, and American mezzo-soprano [Elizabeth DeShong](http://www.elizabethdeshong.com/) will sing Suzuki. Sharing the role of Sharpless is Canadian baritone [Gregory Dahl ](http://www.gregorydahl.com/)and the spectacular [Dwayne Croft](http://imgartists.com/artist/dwayne_croft). _Madama Butterfly _will be conducted by German maestro Patrick Lange; it has a comfy run of twelve shows, October 10th-31st at the Four Seasons Centre. You totally have time to see it twice, once for each cast.

        "body": "Are we a forgiving bunch, us opera-lovers? There's a curious phenomenon of forgiving outdated social mores (racism, for example) in works of theatre and opera that we really like. It seems like fans of opera and musical theatre will look at plenty of bad onstage behaviour in their favourite show, and chalk it up to metaphor or \"the way it was back then\". It's oddly forgiving in a world which feeds largely upon criticism.\n\nJust look at an opera like _Madama Butterfly_. A Google search will return just as many results about _Butterfly_'s controversial reception history as about the show itself. If there were to be a film made with the same plot, it would obviously have to be a masterpiece of racial commentary to pass itself off as anything but racist-championing. And Puccini is at fault too; I'm not saying it isn't fascinating to see how he uses original Japanese melodies throughout his score, but _where_ he uses them is just so suspect. With the exception of her love duet with Pinkerton, Butterfly stubbornly sings in her own modal harmonies and pentatonic tunes. I suppose all the chromaticism gets the best of her, just like it did with Carmen. There's a clear bit of musical racism, I suppose. It has stayed in the mainstream operatic canon since its rocky premiere in 1904; but apparently [everyone is afraid of making judicial changes or cuts](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1542633/Opera-expert-says-Puccinis-Butterfly-is-racist.html) to avoid the more bluntly ignorant moments.\n\nOther culprits are shows like _The Mikado_ for which with each passing year the argument from posterity strengthens. Recently a [Seattle Repertory Theatre](https://www.seattlerep.org/) production of _The Mikado_ [wound up in the press](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/the-problem-with-the-mikado/Content?oid=20174728) for having a cast of nearly 40 singers and actors, none of them Japanese. Awkward casting decisions (and alleged used of \"[yellowface](http://www.nikkeiview.com/blog/2013/05/its-time-to-take-the-offensive-yellowface-of-the-mikado-off-the-stage/)\") aside, _The Mikado_ is consistently at the front of the argument over exoticism as a tool for satire, and simply outdated ways of telling stories. Says Brendan Kiley at [_The Stranger_](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/the-problem-with-the-mikado/Content?oid=20174728), _\"The Mikado_<span style=\"color: #222222;\"> may be brilliant, and its original intentions may have been to satirize British society by way of satirizing a fictionalized version of Japanese society, but it's aggressively obtuse to perform a racially charged, Victorian-era play and not address the problems with the source material.\" There's gross confusion of Japanese and Chinese cultural elements, and the characters have names like Nanki-Poo.</span>\n\nThere's also the racial justification for bad behaviour of traditionally black characters like [Othello](http://dramatica.com/analysis/othello#mc) and [Monostatos](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/09/classicalmusicandopera.comment), who simply can't control their tempers because of they're Moors, and the problem of whether or not _Porgy and Bess_ is too much a story about black people written by white people. Not to mention all those awkward moments in shows like _West Side Story_ or _South Pacific,_ where the American lenses are enough to make you cringe.\n\nI even remember going to the [Stratford Festival](http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/) years ago with my mother to see a few shows, one of which was [_Gigi_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigi_(musical)), the 1958 musical by Lerner and Loewe. The issue with _Gigi_ wasn't racism; it was that the show was about an older bachelor who develops romantic feelings for his old friend's _granddaughter_. He's got songs like \"I Remember it Well\" where he's totally creepy about this much younger girl, but they're written as true love ballads in the context of the show. I remember mom and I wondering afterwards just why _Gigi_ is still done. Maybe the larger message was lost of me, but is there a real need to preserve parts of our culture that represent elements in which we've achieved positive change?\n\nI'll be fair and talk about the historical truth that some cultures become _en vogue_ for other cultures. Everything Turkish was all the rage while Mozart was a live, and at the end of the 19th century, there was a [craze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japonism) for everything Japanese. And there was [plenty of bad science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism) being done resulting in \"scientific racism\", largely towards black people, that helped create \"raging\" characters like Othello.\n\nI just find it fascinating what we decide to ignore in our entertainment. _Madama Butterfly_ has probably stood the test of time largely because the music is so freaking fantastic, just like _Otello_ and _Die Zauberflöte_. _The Mikado_ is G&S, which usually go over well with the general public, as do shows like _South Pacific_ and _West Side Story_. I think the neat thing about this problem is that it will continue to push directors to truly find something to say with these pieces, to the point of being judicious enough to toss the thing in the reject pile, at least for another season.",

        "body": "## PART II\n\nHad she not been on the arm of such a gallant escort, Mewsy certainly would have slipped alighting from Doody Pethers’ elegant sedan.\n\n“I’d forgotten,” she giggled frothily, “How productive we can be. My pumps are drenched!” She dabbed some from the corners of her mouth.\n\n“It’s your charms,” said Pethers indulgently, “I’ve never made so much with Darleen!” Mewsy wrapped her fur over the stain and they went in.\n\nThe lobby sparkled with the decadence of the Upper Crust. It gave Mewsy a shiver right down to her coinpurse to see the wealthy at play.\n\n\"Heavens,\" she breathed, \"How I ADORE the Opera.\" Underneath her extravagant sable, bejewelled digits sought amplification of her frissons.\n\n\"Thank mercy for this stole,\" she said aloud, \"I'm damp again!\"\n\n\"Come, my dear,\" said the impossibly chic Pethers, \"You'll be more comfortable in my private box.\" \"You're stealing my lines!\" Mewsy joshed.\n\nIt WAS a loge to behold. \"How modern!\" oohed Mewsy, \"The carpet doesn't match the drapes!\" \"In your honour, ma'm'selle. And all in velvet.\"\n\n\"Ah, l'Opéra!\" Mewsy positively burbled, \"What a hurricane of taste. L'amour toujours! Toujours gai! What confection will it be tonight?\"\n\n\"_Salome_!\" whispered Doody with scandalous anticipation. \"Look! It's about to start.\" He put his hand right up her petticoats.\n\nThe lights dimmed (or Mewsy's eyes closed, or both) and the orchestra began tuning. \"How that tonal unison quickens the senses!\" she moaned.\n\nDoody Pethers seemed to be rummaging for something in her drawers. \"Down below,\" the conductor appeared and struck up the music.\n\nJust like that the curtain vanished, and already someone was singing! Mewsy gasped and squealed; it was happening so fast this time!\n\n\"Oh, this is the most fabulous one!\" Mewsy gaped as the orchestra creaked and groaned and the singers, all half-naked, yowled passionately.\n\n\"It's all about moon-madness, you know,\" her suitor of the moment insinuated in her ear. A corpse was dragged offstage. Mewsy came.\n\nNow some of the actors were going into a hole! The activity had exhausted Mewsy. She slumped in her chaise. A knock came at the loge door.\n\n\"Admirers,\" said Doody, opening the door to five identical men in black. One advanced, beaming. \"We bear a gift for Ms. Stone.\"\n\n\"We're recipients of the Stone Foundation Grant for Masculinity in Art.\" \"We're the Jews,\" said another, \"And yes, we are TTTTB quintuplets.\"\n\n\"Aren't you just!\" hummed Mewsy, taking in their earnest manner and the pleasing way their robes hung close to their five identical bodies.\n\n\"We've got to be onstage soon,\" said one of them, \"But we wanted to pay respects to the largesse of the Great Patroness of Theatre Arts.\"\n\n\"A token of our gratitude,\" they said, indicating the package Mewsy was tearing into. She drew out a bronze cast of five bodies in action.\n\n\"The full-sized version is being sent to your estate,\" one said. \"It depicts the five of us reënacting a certain traditional Greek game.\"\n\n\"So I see!\" Mewsy inhaled deeply, \"And there's a life-sized rendering, you say? I'm overcome. Please, do visit us again after your scene!\"\n\nThey thanked her and left. Mewsy watched them go. \"How divine,\" she murmured, turning back to the Opera, where a chesty baritone roared.\n\nHe was chained, and a peroxide number in only a slip was rubbing herself up on him. Mewsy reached over to see which side Doody was dressing.\n\nHe, gripped by the spectacle, woke to her touch while pantsless toughs tried to stuff the baritone down the hole (He kept popping back up).\n\nNow the writhing blonde alley-cat was working up a lather over this man who looked, to Mewsy, the very picture of a pastry chef.\n\n\"She begs to kiss him,\" Doody panted, \"She commands it!\" She was milking it, everyone knew, but (thought Mewsy) who cares? It was so exciting.\n\nDoody shot forward. What riveting drama! The king, rushing in, slipped in blood. It seemed to Mewsy she could FEEL it, warm and viscous.\n\nMewsy wiped her hand on Doody's splayed lap. \"Look!\" she said, \"Our Jews!\" The five Masculine Scholars were starting to wrestle (vocally).\n\n\"They are so determined!\" Mewsy smiled inwardly, \"My boys. What fortitude!\" Their voices shrieked. \"How noble!\" she sighed.\n\nThe striving quints were succeeded onstage by a domestic scene, and Mewsy turned to the door, awaiting their return. At last they burst in.\n\nThe lads had lost their heavy robes, and seemed filled with new life now that they wore the regulation uniform of the Scholars of Manhood.\n\nThe tank-and-shorts combo was slight, so as not to strain the imagination. \"Perfect!\" crowed Mewsy. (Even freshly used Doody was grinning.)\n\n\"We've come, as requested,\" the foreman said, \"To reiterate our gratitude to you.\" \"Let us do something for you in return.\"\n\nJust then the frightfully cultured Pethers leapt up with fervour and sang out, \"Here it comes! The Dance of the Seven Veils!\"\n\nA primal throbbing in the orchestra shook them, and, as so often happens at the Opera, animal instinct took control. The men surrounded her.\n\n\"The Seven Veils?\" Mewsy said, loosening her bodice, \"Why, there are seven of us!\" Intoxicated by tambourines, she freed her curious hands.\n\nThe Gentlemen Scholars' shorts now ceased any pretense of modesty.\n\nThree at a time the studious studs began to know Mewsy as well as they obviously knew this music. Doody pitched in to keep the others warm.\n\n\"Oh, my stars! My very word!\" Mewsy declared. Everything was hair, fur and muscles. \"I've yet to be disappointed by a night at the Opera!\"\n\nAfter nine very full minutes the tenor hollered emphatically and the septet found itself happily spent. Mewsy whimpered with satisfaction.\n\n\"We must dress for curtain call,\" said the bass Scholar, bending over respectfully. Again they turned to go, giving Mewsy her money's worth.\n\nWhen at last Mewsy looked back to the stage, she practically squirted with delight. \"My favourite part!\" she rhapsodized, \"The love song!\"\n\nIt was bliss. Mewsy sank into the embrace of sensual pleasures as the ingenue before them serenaded the severed head she cradled.\n\n\"_Du warst schön..._\" Mewsy echoed. She shuddered with deep feeling. \"_Du warst schön!_\" She felt a creeping chill. \"_Du... warst... schön.....!_\"\n\nMewsy started awake, shaking with cold under the merciless desert dawn, and it all came flooding back.\n\n[...if you're craving more Mewsy](http://mewsytheadulteress.com/).",

        "body": "A few articles popped up recently about the problem of anxiety and depression amongst classical musicians. A survey done by [Help Musicians UK](https://www.helpmusicians.org.uk/news/latest-news/health-and-wellbeing-see-the-results-of-our-survey) sampled after 500 working musicians (about 20% of them singers), and found that 60% claimed to have suffered from a psychological concern such as depression and/or debilitating anxiety. A study by Health.com showed that artists are [ranked fifth](http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20428990_6,00.html) in the top 10 careers with the highest rate of depression. Not surprisingly for artists, the biggest sources of stress are anti-social work hours, money problems and work insecurity; following closely behind are relationship problems, travelling and lack of proper exercise/nutrition.\n\nAnd it's not limited to issues of mental health; plenty of musicians turn to prescription drugs and alcohol so that they can handle their nerves onstage and off. Cellist [Rachael Lander ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11041804/Addicts-Symphony-drink-and-drugs-widespread-in-classical-world-says-cellist.html)explains, \"There is the lifestyle, the odd hours, working weekends, post-concert socialising. Many players use alcohol and beta-blockers to control their performance anxiety and then, after the 'high' of a performance, musicians can struggle to 'come down' and therefore drink to relax – which becomes habitual.\"\n\nIt's of course a problem in the opera world, which is a place where the troubles of classical musicians can become amplified. Like any working musician, opera singers struggle to achieve and maintain an impeccable technique, all while being constantly at risk of losing work with a poorly-timed illness or off-day. But even aside from musical demands, singers face many of the same mental hurdles as do professional actors. They have to think about their looks, and the more successful a singer is, the more they have to maintain a public image that is unsullied and scandal-free. The demand for perfection isn't necessarily higher for opera singers than other musicians, but that demand definitely comes from more types of people. According to German tenor [Endrik Wottrich](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/19/germany.classicalmusic), \"The real pressure is no longer good old stage fright but comes from a new dimension that has penetrated opera - it now lives from glamour, and normal human mistakes are a disruption in such an environment.\" And when it comes to those of us prone to seeking the potentially harmful \"quick fixes\" for all this stress, there's a perfect storm surrounding those who seek the operatic spotlight.\n\nPeople have been trying to figure out why artists are so prone to issues concerning mental health and substance abuse for centuries, and I'm not going to claim to have a new answer. [This article](http://creativesomething.net/post/55508909341/the-link-between-depression-and-creativity-and-how-it) suggests that naturally creative people who are drawn to the arts are very contemplative, spending lots of time thinking about their own thoughts. Major depression is found to be exacerbated when one [ruminates](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/01/20/why-ruminating-is-unhealthy-and-how-to-stop/) on an idea or experience, and overthinking things is something artists do really well.\n\nA couple of cool things to come out of this hard topic: this summer at the [Edinburgh Fringe Festival](https://www.edfringe.com/), the new [Arts and Minds](http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2014/08/industry-wide-initiative-protect-actors-mental-health-problems/) initiative was set up to raise awareness about the difficulties that those working in the theatre arts can face. As part of the initiative, the festival this year featured the new Sanctuary, a space designed specifically for Fringe performers to be \"a calm, quiet place within Fringe Central, where participants can get away from things\".\n\nAnd, back on the musical side of things, there's the really amazing [Addicts' Symphony](https://twitter.com/AddictsSymphony). It was started by composer James McConnel, who is a recovering alcoholic and who tragically lost his 18-year-old son to a drug overdose in 2011\\. James started the Addicts' Symphony project in order to help others avoid a similar fate, and to seek the help that's available simply in the act of making music communally. He recruited a group of 10 recovering addict musicians to play and write music together, coaching it alongside the London Symphony Orchestra. Read about the project [here](http://blog.lso.co.uk/lso-discovery/addicts-symphony/), and watch the Channel 4 [documentary about it here](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/addicts-symphony/4od#3748522), if geography is on your side.\n\nI wonder if stats like the above have ever been brought up in discussions about funding the arts? There may indeed be a veritable link between creative personalities and tendency towards psychological issues, but two of the top reasons these musicians gave for why they're so strained to begin with are related to job security and adequate pay. It's a simple as this: with better funding for orchestras, choirs, concert halls, opera houses, arts education, etc., more art could be produced by more working artists. Maybe the chance to ease some of the work and financial stress in the lives of artists is enough of a bonus to convince more people of the value of the arts.\n\nNaïve as it may sound, I think it's fortunate that these creative people suffering from depression have their creative outlet. For musicians, their craft might not be working as a cure for their lowest days; but it's at the very least a way to make something good come out of what seems bad.",

[Reddit Timemachine](http://www.reddittimemachine.com/choiceofwords/posts/music.html) put out a survey of music fans from various [subreddits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#Subreddits) about Classical music, jazz, punk, reggae, etc. The results were based on searching for specific words in each subreddit, showing the different frequencies that word is used in different fan circles. Predictably, Classical music had the least profanity, because we're a classy bunch; it also came in second for the most amount of talk about music theory (just behind jazz). We're apparently descriptive; when it came to words like \"awesome\", \"beautiful\", and \"wonderful\", Classical music had the most evenly distributed vocabulary. That sounds mundane, but I actually think it's sort of significant.\n\nThe final graph shows how much music fans of one genre mention other genres. Classical music, along with metal, is one of the most interactive groups. Electronic music, metal, and trance all talk about Classical music, and Classical music talks a lot about metal and hip-hop (seems random to me). Interestingly, jazz and punk didn't have much to say about anything other than jazz and punk.\n\nAnyway, I think it's neat and revealing.

        "body": "### What can people expect from an \"a cappella theatrical epic\"?\n\nThis is a hard production to categorize and I myself am coming to grips with this work being labeled as an 'a cappella theatrical epic.' But I will work with this definition and break it down as best as possible. It is a cappella in that it is fully sung without any external assistance from instruments or recordings. It is theatrical in that we are aiming toward a full narrative with a strong beginning, middle and end. We are using the tools and conventions of theatre in production to help convey the story. It is epic for its subject matter (the Salem witch trials), its scope (it looks at the source history that is not typically shared in Salem's history including slavery and traditional African spirituality) and the mere logistics (20 women on stage, 30 plus songs in this workshop production)!\n\n### What do you think is unique about the workshop process of this piece?\n\nEverything about this process is unique. We have the many moving variables of music and narration. As a composer who does not have formal music training, my method to create the music is to record all part of the composition vocally with a microphone and music software. It is then given to Music Director Andrew Craig, whose task is to digest the material and then map the music onto the performers’ bodies. Most of our performers don't read music. We have actors in the cast who can also sing and we have singers who can also act - an amazing combination. This is quite a huge challenge for Andrew to work with. To top off that, many of the production crew are wearing many hats: Andrew is also a producer; I'm the librettist, composer, performer and producer etc.). We found throughout this process that if we need to solve something for the overall story, it has to go through the musical sieve, where we will then see that it needs to be readjusted for libretto and musicality, and THEN it goes to the performers and from there needs to be readjusted again. The work is very specific and detailed and challenging at times, but when something clicks, we are all reminded of the necessity of this project. \n### What makes Obeah Opera a play that adapts well to a musical setting?\n\nOne of the unique aspects of this piece musically is that it's sourced from many different genres of contemporary and traditional music. This goes a long way in creating atmosphere and aesthetic short cuts for the audience. When we hear a tango, we know there is tension. When we hear a ballad we know a character is emoting. The witch trials themselves were horrific and terrible and a shameful part of history. But in hindsight, there was also unique sociological occurrences that are implemented in this play: the introspection and 'analysis' of slavery, women’s injustice, mass hysteria; mingling of traditional and contemporary spiritualism; revolutionary activities by girls and adolescences. These themes are big and require a big production to do them justice; exploring them musically not only makes sense but aids in telling a story that carries such density. \n\n### What is special about this account of the Salem Witch Trials?\n\nWhen people think of the Salem witch trials, they think of the story of white women. Arthur Miller first popularized Tituba in [The Crucible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible) but this version centralizes the narrative of the black slaves who through the faults of historical recording were never given the opportunity for their story to be shared. \n\n### Can you tell us about your process of creating _Obeah Opera_, and adapting it to include music?\n\nMy process in creating this work has been a huge learning curve on how I create. As stated earlier, I have no previous institutional musical training though I do have a background conducting choirs and being a performer. All of these skills were honed by ear and 'practice'. My process is unconventional by many means. I learned depending on 'the moment' that I was working on in this work, which came to me in a variety of ways. I may hear the music first or I may form the libretto first and then add music -- there is no set way the work came to me.\nWhen Andrew Craig came on board as MD in this process, I explained to him my current process (which wasn't very efficient and I had become frustrated because I didn't know how to share what was in my head). He provided me with the equipment needed and instructed me to sing everything I had in my head so that he could facilitate bringing the music to not only the performers but to the audience. He assured me that I wasn't 'mad' and gave me the necessary tools to bring out the work. I am forever indebted to him for this incredible gift.\n\nThat is the musical process as best as I can describe it.\n\nBut I am also inclined to talk about the book and librettist process, where another incredible gift was given. As an emerging playwright, I had spent many years piecing together moments that I was convinced had to be in the play. When Nightwood Theatre stepped in, they gave me an amazing dramaturg (Erica Kopyto) and full assistance in the developmental stage to create a strong narrative. This is not necessarily something that is found in conventional opera, but there was a need to honour and tell the story of Tituba and these women in a full and rich way.\n\nThe combination of these gifts shows me that there is indeed a two-step process when creating a new work: creating the music versus looking at the narrative and deciding how the music and genre best serve those moments.\n\n### What do you see as the next steps for this piece after this current workshop?\n\nThe road thus far is pretty set. We present 5 shows as part of this workshop presenting excerpts from the fully developed work in Nightwood's New Groundswell Festival. From there I'm told I get a 12 hour break before we begin responding to all of the feedback from the process. We'll need to adjust songs/libretto and look at scenes and characterization to finesse everything we have learned in the last 3 weeks of rehearsal. Which I might add has been intense! This workshop is a tool to get us to the final stage of development so that the script and music are ready as we move toward the final production set for July 2015 during PANAMANIA, the arts and culture program of the Toronto 2015 Pan Am and Parapan Am Games .\n\nCatch the shows this weekend, September 11-14th.

The baby's body was found by a contractor in 2007, wrapped in a newspaper dated September 15, 1925\\. The baby's parents are still unknown, but upon its discovery, [Rita Rich](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2007/09/24/does_mummified_baby_have_living_cousin.html) gave insight into the family who lived at 29 Kintyre.\n\nDean Burry (_The Brothers Grimm_, _Isis and the Seven Scorpions_) saw the operatic potential of the story, including \"a cast of characters straight from a mystery novel: the glamourous vamp, the mysterious houseguest, the prudish and suicidal wife, the adulterous husband and the simple little girl whose bedroom ceiling became the resting place of a horrible secret.\" The opera-as-radio-serial is totally engrossing right from the start. We initially meet Bob (sung by [James McLennan](http://www.jamesmclennan.com/)), the contractor who discovers the baby while on the phone with his wife, Jill ([Laura Albino](http://www.lauraalbino.com/)). The story is bookended by the present day, with most of the action set in 29 Kintyre in 1925\\. Interspersed are clips from Mary Wiens' and John Nicol's coverage of the story on CBC's [Metro Morning](http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/) in 2007 (the recording includes the full broadcast).\n\nI was struck first by the immediacy of the recording; I suppose our ears get used to working a bit to understand the singers, but the production by [David Jaeger](http://www.musiccentre.ca/node/37220/biography) kept the voices very present and easy to place. I immediately felt a sense of nostalgia with the radio serial genre, including the added sound effects of creaking floorboards and telephone-effects; it really is a fantastic feat in real storytelling. The orchestra (which features my graduate teacher, [Dr. John Hess](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2013/02/08/sad-news-torontos-queen-of-puddings-music-theatre-to-cease-operations-at-end-of-season/), on the piano) plays like a chameleon, with music that goes in and out of the foreground, acting almost like going from diegetic to non-diegetic music in film. Dean's music cedes to the story all the time, often turning on a dime with a dramatic shift; it reminded me of how Britten writes, with transparency and spontaneity that are hard to covey. At one point, Dean uses two characters at the piano to juxtapose against a marital spat happening in the other room (song-within-the-song style); it's incredibly clear, even without visual help.\n\nThe music didn't sound easy to sing, but the singers were clear and specific, and found a way to move organically between singing and speech. Young soprano Eileen Nash sang the role of Rita Rich (at 10 years old); she's a strong performer with just enough of that eeriness that comes when kids sing opera. As Rita's Uncle Wesley and Aunt Della, [Giles Tomkins](http://www.gilestomkins.com/) and [Shannon Mercer](http://www.shannonmercer.com/) impressively give us the multiple layers of communication that exist within a troubled marriage. Baritone[ Benjamin Covey](http://www.domoneyartists.com/Baritone/Covey_Bio/covey_bio.html) is energetic and tragic as their houseguest, George, singing some of my favourite music of the show. My favourite has to be the fantastic [Krisztina Szabó](http://www.krisztinaszabo.com/) as Aunt Ella Mae, the \"glamourous vamp\" who seems to be the most sensible choice for the mysterious baby's mother. Her music is full of growling saxophones and a yapping dog, right out of a 50s gangster movie. It made me imagine that Krisztina had red hair when they recorded _Baby Kintyre_.\n\nI think the most appealing thing about this recording is that it's an organic piece of art. Listening to recordings of operas is often like reading a play; it's not quite what you're after. But in the case of _Baby Kintyre_, the genre lends itself beautifully to a recording; it's a complete piece of art that the listener really can take with them. The episodes are musically autonomous, but they all lead ominously into the next (often with a telling _thunk_ from the piano); there's a larger musical continuity that remains familiar throughout the whole opera. I think it's my favourite piece of Dean Burry's, and this recording by [Centrediscs](http://www.musiccentre.ca/recordings/centrediscs) is an important addition to the [Canadian Music Centre](http://www.musiccentre.ca/)'s canon.\n\n_Baby Kintyre_ is freshly released, and available at the [Canadian Music Centre](http://www.musiccentre.ca/node/123392) and on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/dean-burry-baby-kintyre/id909653710).",

        "body": "###Why pair together _Ba-ta-clan_ and _L'île du rêve_?\n\nWe thought these operas paired nicely together for a few reasons. They are both examples of \"Orientalism\", which was a popular aesthetic in France around the turn of the century. They are both firsts for their respective composers - Hahn's first opera, Offenbach's first big hit - yet today they are not often performed. Beyond this, the two works contrast in mood and affect, so the audience will really get to experience the emotional highs and lows of French operatic repertoire.\n\n### What messages are timeless for audiences in these two pieces?\n\nThe Hahn is all about love and coming into one's own sexuality. I think most people have experienced a first love. The one you think is going to last forever. The one that is all-consuming, and completely irrational. The people who have experienced this kind of love will most likely have also experienced the end of it. It can be quite devastating. These types of romances have been written about throughout history, and continue to be written about today - sometimes in the form of sparkly vampires.\n_Ba-ta-clan_ by Offenbach seems quite relevant now, as we get closer to the municipal election. Ba-ta-clan is a call to action. A message to take back the government and give power to the people. The sad truth is that sometimes power passes out of the hands of one tyrant, and into the arms of another.\n\n### What can audiences expect from this double bill?\n\nBe prepared to cry, to laugh, and to witness some amazing performances from our cast. \n\n### How does Offenbach/Hahn coincide with Opera 5's mandate?\n\nOpera 5 seeks to foster the next generation of opera audiences. This show is a co-production with [Alliance Francaise de Toronto](http://www.alliance-francaise.ca/en), and through this partnership we hope to reach out to Toronto's French community. Our cast has worked incredibly hard learning spoken dialogue in French, and memorizing a large amount of French repertoire. We may not be Francophones, but after this production, we can certainly call ourselves Francophiles. Opera 5's Offenbach/Hahn opens this Friday night.

        "body": "ll the talk about _The Death of Klinghoffer_. Andrea Peyser at the _New York Post_ just published [this piece](http://nypost.com/2014/09/15/the-met-operas-new-musical-celebration-promoting-bigotry/), stating, \"The Met is to present an obscene opera titled 'The Death of Klinghoffer' — a musical celebration of the senseless murder by Palestinian monsters of a defenseless, elderly Jewish New Yorker.\" Sigh. Quick briefing: _Klinghoffer_ is based on the [1985 hijacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achille_Lauro_hijacking) of the cruise ship _Achille Lauro_ by Palestinian terrorists; Leon Klinghoffer was a Jewish, wheelchair-bound passenger on the ship, and the anti-Semitic terrorists shot him and threw his body overboard. John Adams' _The Death of Klinghoffer_ was in the news earlier this year when Peter Gelb decided to cancel its HD broadcast (he ceded to claims of anti-Semitism, including from the Anti-Defamation League's Abraham Foxman, who even admitted he _hadn't seen it_.) Now, the piece is still set to [hit the stage at the Met](http://www.metopera.org/opera/the-death-of-klinghoffer-adams-tickets) starting October 20th, and new protests are scheduled.\nDid you know that there's a [Coalition Against Terror Opera](http://www.bcjewishlink.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4771:the-coalition-against-terror-opera-cato-calls-for-protest-at-the-met&catid=150:news&Itemid=562) (CATO)? I know, right? There's also COPMA, or [Citizens Opposed to Propaganda Masquerading as Art](http://www.copma.net/). Now, these organizations make me confused and amused at the same time, but they're loud and organized; \"[CATO](http://schmopera.com/wp-admin/CATO%20believes%20that%20incontrovertible%20evidence%20exists%20in%20the%20libretto%20by%20Alice%20Goodman,%20and%20in%20remarks%20made%20by%20Gelb%20and%20the%20composer,%20John%20Adams,%20that%20the%20opera%20supports%20sympathy%20for%20terrorists%20and%20hatred%20for%20Jews%20and%20Israel.) believes that incontrovertible evidence exists in the libretto by Alice Goodman, and in remarks made by Gelb and the composer, John Adams, that the opera supports sympathy for terrorists and hatred for Jews and Israel.\" And COPMA's latest achievement seems to be [this ad](http://www.copma.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/COPMA_Ad_Klinghoffer2.pdf) for the protest they're staging outside Lincoln Center on September 22nd (5pm, in case you're free).\n\nWith the [odd mention](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqLrrGFPL9w&t=2m33s) about the opera being titled _The Death of Klinghoffer_ (it should have been called _The Murder of Klinghoffer_, apparently), the opposition seems to centre on the so-called \"Romanticism\" of the terrorists, or sympathy for their actions. The characters who are supposed to be the villains get beautiful music to sing, and they are developed as humans, just like the \"good guys\". Says Andrea at the _New York Post_, \"'The Death of Klinghoffer' has outraged some audiences. But it also has inspired hatred among people of all religions with its romantic portrayal of an act of violence committed by creatures who don’t deserve to breathe air.\" I have the sense that those who take offence to _Klinghoffer_ do so because there isn't enough hate directed towards the Palestinians, and that's a frightening reason to boycott art. Robert Fink, in his[ incredible article](https://www.academia.edu/441205/Klinghoffer_in_Brooklyn_Heights) on this subject, puts it perfectly: \"[Adams' and Sellars'] original pride in the fact that ‘absolutely no sides were taken’ (Adams), that the sombre work strove to reach ‘a human level, beyond all political differences’ (Sellars), has hardened over the years into a ﬁrm conviction that they are being punished simply for their temerity in giving the Palestinians in their opera any voice at all.\"\n\nIt's a disturbing thought that such vocal masses of people don't see the hypocrisy in demanding their villains (or Palestinians, in this case) stay monstrous, without layers, black and white and unforgivable. [Mark S. Golub](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqLrrGFPL9w&t=27m59s) on Shalom TV provides some of this eerie duplicity: \"Artistic freedom does not permit you to glorify this kind of murder. Glorify. If it had been, you know, the Palestinians in this were really shown to be barbaric, who cares? But it's not what this opera is meant to do, and the very title of it is so telling.\" This is crass hypocrisy, the confusion of glorifying the behaviour versus the people doing it. Do people honestly think that some audience members come away from a performance of _The Death of Klinghoffer_ thinking that Leon Klinghoffer got what he deserved?\n\nIt seems obvious to me that if someone wants to rally a bunch of people to do something like hijack a boat or kill a man because he's Jewish, you convince those people that what they're doing is for good, is right. And no matter what the cause, if there's a group of people banding together for what they think is right, you've got real human beings. Then again, if enemies were in the business of trying to understand each other, they'd less likely be enemies.\n\n[Tom Service](http://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/jun/18/the-death-of-klinghoffer-if-john-adams-opera-isnt-anti-semitic-how-can-it-fan-anti-semitism) at _The Guardian_ said it well: \"There’s no need to rehearse the arguments about the opera’s treatment of the passengers and terrorists on board the _Achille Lauro_ in 1985: how the piece clearly voices the grief of Klinghoffer and his wife, and equally clearly, how it exposes the disastrously twisted world-view of the terrorists, while also acknowledging and voicing, in powerfully moving choruses, the feelings of communities on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\"\n\nAnd I get the feeling that the ADL isn't the only one who didn't bother to see _Klinghoffer _before defaming it publicly. You don't even have to dig far into thelibretto before you'll find a damning line sung by Mamoud, one of the fictional terrorists: \"The day that I and my enemy sit peacefully, each putting his case and working towards peace, that day our hope dies and I shall die too.\" Pretty darn evil, considering that _Klinghoffer_ was accused of being too easy on the Palestinian terrorists.\n\nThis fight isn't new, [not for _Klinghoffer_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c81s3FwSaaY) and not for theatre. You could remind anti-_Klinghoffers_ about artistic freedom, or how \"being offended\" doesn't necessarily warrant any action at all. Appropriately, I'm reminded of something Peter Sellars said about Greek theatre; he talked about how the tragedies were meant to give a voice to those who didn't get one in the \"real world\", like women and foreigners (Sophocles' _The Women of Trachis_ and _Oedipus Rex_). It's historically ignorant to try and control how a particular group of people should be portrayed in theatre, especially since it's a function of art to challenge societal norms. The protests at Lincoln Center will happen, people will call it \"offensive\" and \"obscene\", and I hope they'll get remembered alongside the riots at _The Rite of Spring_ and _Carmen_. It's a dangerous thing, protesting against opinions that oppose yours, when history will keep racking up examples of the times those protests didn't work. If I were Peter Gelb, I'd extend an invitation to some of the rehearsals so the protesters can actually _see_ the opera. I suppose that would be a start.",

        "body": "This is a guest post by baritone, theatre buff and frequent contributor Gregory Finney. For more by Greg, [click here](http://schmopera.com/author/greg/). Last night was opening night at the New Theatre [Alliance Française de Toronto](http://www.alliance-francaise.ca/) for [Opera 5's](http://www.operafive.com/) (check out their [Opera Cheats](http://www.operafive.com/media/)) season opener: a romp through the French obsession with the Far East during the 19th century. We were treated to a double bill of _Île du rêve_ by Reynaldo Hahn and _Ba-Ta-Clan_ By Jacques Offenbach, two very different pieces that not only show the varied differences of the East's influence on Western music, but also the versatility of a stellar cast of darn fine singers.\n\nFirst up was the Hahn, an etherial sounding one-act drama (subject matter akin to _Madama Butterfly_ et al...) set on the island of Bora Bora, in what we now know as French Polynesia.\n\nMahénu, a 16-year-old (#arenttheyalways) pure Polynesian flower, known throughout for the loveliness of her voice, meets and falls in love with the French Soldier B.F. Pinkerton (just kidding and it's my last one, I promise). She falls in love Georges de Kervan - who the island girls later name \"Loti\", which is much easier. Coming to the island, he seeks the maid who his now-deceased brother once loved to bring her the bad news. Teria, is found mad in the woods, and is coaxed back by the two lovers, only to see Mahénu go through the same tragedy she had years prior. As is often the way of these tales, Mahénu dies of a broken heart.\n\n[Teiya Kasahara](http://www.teiyakasahara.com/teiyakasahara/welcome.html)</span> sings a much more lyric line this time in the role of the 16-year-old flower of the island. The unforgiving acoustic of the hall was no match for the power, beauty and skill of her instrument. Long lines, skillful roulades and tasteful portamenti are what you're going to hear from her performance. [Adrian Kramer](https://twitter.com/aitkramer) as Loti has a strong, masculine tenor that can be surprisingly powerful. A handsome lyric with a facility to move from his mid-range to very high that makes him a treat to hear. The staid Princess Orena, (who when for the first time in one of these stories the lovers decide to take the girl with them, we find out that the women of their Isle of Dreams wither and perish on foreign soil) was sung by Emma Bergin. A mezzo-soprano still in undergraduate studies, it's a voice with promise and I look forward to hearing its growth.\n\n[Ben Covey's](http://www.domoneyartists.com/Baritone/Covey_Bio/covey_bio.html) delicious baritone lends a perfectly empathetic tone to Mahenu's father, making the tragic end that much more poignant.\n\nThe music, Romantic with shout-outs to Debussy and Eastern harmonies, lulls you into a unique soundscape. The tempi are all very similar and all very moderato and I feel as though Hahn may have robbed the story of some of the drama. The stylized movement lent themselves well to the design and the soundscape of the piece, but I felt they may have been a little under-motivated.\n\nOz Weaver's lighting design was magic. His use of ambient blues and magentas, along with fuschia and blue gradients on the cyclorama with the golden wash for the performers made you feel like somewhere light was definitely playing off the water.\n\nBig-ups to the blooming-flower-dress-projection.\n\nIntermission - I'm loving this trend of specific cocktails to go along with your show. Opera 5 loves to stimulate all five senses (get it? Opera 5?), so they served up a pineapple mimosa and a spiced rum and ginger beer to give an extra air of the tropics to the evening. I had one of each. They were delicious. Full stop. #awesomesauce\n\nUp next we ended the night in uproarious farce _Ba-Ta-Clan._ We're greeted by the full ensemble in a full on farce-chase scene as we hear the overture.There's civil unrest and the people are really rallying behind Ké-Ki-Ko-Kan (Covey)(*couMIKADOgh* {but to be fair the Offenbach came first}) to rid themselves of Fé-Ni-Han (Kramer) and the other chinese nobles Ké-Ki-Ka-Ko (Justin Ralph) and Fé-An-Nich-Ton (Kasahara). Oddly enough, none of them are actually Chinese and have been pretending to be so to avoid execution in their native France. Just as it's all about to go down, we find out Ko-Ko-Ri-Ko is actually French as well.\n\nI found this piece to be a bit more accessible. Perhaps it's my own intimate experience with operetta (I've done my fair share, I tell you whut...), or the fact that the extreme humour allows you to suspend your disbelief that much further. Or maybe it was the presence of up-tempo numbers, but who's to say?\n\nI'm a huge Offenbach fan. He's incredibly difficult to sing, let alone sing well as all of these folks did.\n\nCovey as the leader of the rebels, moves with a swagger befitting Escamillo (a nod to Bizet, conscious or no) handles the quick texts and Jasmine Chen's active staging excellently.\n\n[Justin Ralph](http://justinralph.com/) is Ke-Ki-Ka-Ko is hilarious! Also a seasoned operetta performer, he handled the score incredibly well, with a light, clear, piercing tenor that got put to great use whilst mimicking a trumpet, singing the _Ba-Ta-Clan._ Seriously though, it's worth the price of admission just for this one number (but the rest is great so that's gravy). Kasahara flexes those coloratura chops to our delight once again as Fe-An-Nich-ton, nee Virginie Durand. Operetta coloratura is surprisingly challenging, given how much of the scores are high octane polkas, mazurkas, marches and waltzes, and Kasahara dances over them with ease and pleasure. Her expressive face and ridiculous yet fabulous costuming are a perfect match for this kind of repertoire. It helps hide the serious satire under the guise of silly caricature and it's really hard to attain the proper balance. She does and it's wonderful.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, Kramer kills it as Fé-An-Nich-Ton.\n\nPhysical comedy and Classical singing are not always the best of friends. They both put extreme demands on your body and occupy an enourmous amount of your brain power. Yet when you see it done well, it's breathtaking. Although, I found the role may have sat a little low for him, his character work was something to see. Everyone in the cast moves at a blistering pace, but Kramer runs circles around them, pulling out some choice takes in the process. #doffscap\n\nMakai Nash's playing was equally as versatile and nuanced. The Hahn, while having its own identity, definitely gave you the moments of Impressionism and Eastern flair dancing effortlessly around each other. The Offenbach, was playful, quick, nimble and precise. A fine orchestra indeed. Matthew Vaile's production design married perfectly with both scores. A clean, crisp set for the Hahn, and a lush vibrant palette for the Offenbach.\n\nThe show runs again Saturday (September 19) and Sunday (20) at 7:30PM at the New Theatre Alliance Française. Tickets are available online or at the door: $25.00 General Admission/ $20.00 for Alliance members. (Bonus: They take credit cards)\n\nSeriously folks, hit this one up, it's a good time.",

        "body": "I indulged in some Pavarotti & Friends today, and pulled out a few favourites to share. I recognized that song recipe for Pavarotti's duets with famous pop singers: the famous pop singer starts off by singing the first verse _au naturel_, and Pav joins in for the second verse, in Italian, with what sometimes sounds like a totally new melody. It made me think vaguely of team of [song-arrangers](http://www.discogs.com/artist/10529-Henry-Mancini) that work on a Pavarotti & Friends program, and then imagine a bizarre rehearsal between Pav and, say, Bryan Adam. These duets always start off odd for me, since I'm always wondering what Pavarotti is really thinking when he shares the stage with people like [Stevie Wonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoClSToRAxM) and [Barry White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCcM_uV-r8&list=PL-alyau4BfH4H04iXV3FooJpGu3WdSF-c). Sometimes I can't get over the difference in the simple _singing_ between Pav and basically anyone else, as if some of these pop singers subject themselves to exposure by singing with someone like Pavarotti. But I shake that off, and begin with this arrangement of \"Hero\" with Mariah Carey.\n\nMariah isn't concerned about her technique not standing up to Pav's; she's too busy enjoying her little touches of backup during his solo:\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsvYT8QZRjE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nWhen two singers whom you already love do a duet together, they really can do no wrong. So here's Pavarotti and Frank Sinatra, singing \"My Way\". The song actually lets Pavarotti _sing_, even in English (but I of course find his Italian accent charming: \"I deed eeta maaaiiiiiia waaaayyya!\"), and I think it's one of the best duet pairings in the whole P&F canon.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vb_xHWgb2s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nThis one is totally weird; you can see that Pavarotti thinks James Brown is a lunatic, and it's hilarious. The song, however, is kind of infectious.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qHz5AuXHejc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nLastly, this gem with Pavarotti and Céline Dion, \"I love you and then I hate you\". Take or leave Céline, but she holds her ground as a duet partner with Pav; she's even into the song, not just letting it survive on Pavarotti's presence alone. Pretty impressive, and I'm not even into Céline.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xixX75qksjc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nWhat are your favourite duets from Pavarotti & Friends?

Were they spreading the word about shows to see? Were they publishing profiles and reviews of artists? Were they vouching for the arts and bringing awareness to the current events that concern artists and art-lovers? The answer was \"yes\"; everyone was writing about opera, who was making it happen and whether or not they were doing a good job of it.\n\nSo what was the point of my starting yet another blog about opera and music? I figured I could sprinkle some grains of salt onto the kind of rhetoric that already exists, including reviewing performances, interviewing artists and keeping an eye on the state of the arts in our current culture. There has always been a healthy amount of hostility between arts critics and the artists themselves; artists get misunderstood by critics, and critics arguably act as a liaison between the art and the audience, despite the fact that the majority of critics don't actually do what the artists do. I have the advantage of being a current, working member of the opera industry, and also motivated to write about it, because I'm personally and professionally invested in keeping the arts in a healthy state.\n\nSo what if reviews, artist profiles, etc., could actually draw the audience into the process of creating opera? People are naturally curious, and they're more inclined to seek out something new if they know something about it's created, and about the people involved. Opera, like Classical music in general, has been hesitant to show audiences the unglamourous, dirty, sometimes tedious process of actually putting a performance on its feet; after all, opera is grand, and it makes sense that we'd want to show it off the final results (divas, tuxes, glitzy opera houses, etc.). But the glam-wow factor of opera doesn't pack the same punch with the public anymore; now, audiences want to know their artists.\n\nAnd that's why I write from the inside. I was at first apprehensive about attaching my name to a new blog, fearing conflicts of interest like reviewing my own colleagues and friends. I've since identified myself, and it's been a novel experience to be able to bring audiences right into the rehearsal room. I think opera folk (singers, conductors, directors, the whole lot) are incredible people who live huge, exaggerated, brave lives. I think their stories are what will surprise the general public, even more than the stories of the operas they create.",

In the case of de Billy, the disagreement [began in March](http://www.kctv5.com/story/26541560/2nd-conductor-resigns-from-vienna-state-opera) over one bar of music in a production of _Lohengrin _(really, _one bar?_); after the argument, Meyer said he \"no longer had trust\" in di Billy.\n\nThis is most likely a fluke streak of mysterious drama bubbles; but without any of the details available, it seems like something got blown out of proportion (to an operatic size, one might say). It's entertaining for me to imagine these opera types, having an impassioned spat over Wagner (and probably money). Anyway, I hope Opera di Roma and the Staatsoper manage to find themselves a good musical fit, and I'll be keeping my eyes open in case the trend of the-conductor-who-leaves-in-a-huff continues.\n\nSpeaking of a good fight:\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWSMQlPTMNg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>",

        "body": "Yesterday in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, the Canadian Opera Company's [Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx) kicked off the new season of the [Free Concert Series](http://www.coc.ca/performancesandtickets/freeconcertseries.aspx). This year there are three new singers and one new pianist in the Ensemble. I'll admit the concert wasn't my first encounter with the COC young artists; I've had the opportunity to see them at work in recent weeks, but I was no less excited to hear them all sing their \"introductory\" arias. I'm a past member of the COC Ensemble, and I have a clear memory of how nerve-wracking this annual inaugural concert is. As refreshing and impressive as the Amphitheatre is, there's something intimidating about the light-filled space, with the audience around and above you. For this[ _Meet the Artists_](http://files.coc.ca/pdfs/concert140923.pdf) concert, the phrase \"sing for Grandma\" comes to mind.\n\nThe Ensemble Studio wasn't entirely in top health (three out of the nine singers were sadly out sick), but they really are a strong group this year. The new members in particular were super exciting to hear. Bass-baritone [Iain MacNeil](http://www.iainmacneil.com/bio) started off with \"Rivolgete a lui lo sguardo\" (_Così fan tutte_). He has a warm and clear sound, already much richer than when I heard him last, as Sid in UofT's _Albert Herring_. I'm excited to hear him develop more boom in his voice; he's off to a solid start at the COC this season.\n\nTenor [Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=25771) is also a new Ensemble member, and absolutely a breath of fresh air; his rendition of \"Vainement, ma bien-aimeé\" (_Le roi d'Ys_) was, well, stunning. He sang with an open and honest sound, full of agility and ring and moments of _pianissimo_ singing that nearly tore my heart out (#slain). His presence onstage was as warm as his singing; you really couldn't help but love him. I know Jean-Philippe is a dedicated worker, and he'll be someone to watch in the coming seasons.\n\nThe last of the new Ensemble members was Québec native [Karine Boucher](http://karineboucher.com/), who sang \"O mio babbino caro\" (_Gianni Schicchi_). I absolutely love Karine's voice; it's rich and womanly soprano sound, with a quality about it that is completely her own. When Karine sings, it's like you can hear her guts. She's a class act, and I can't wait to hear more.\n\nThree (healthy) returning Ensemble members showed off their stuff as well. Mezzo-soprano [Charlotte Burrage](https://twitter.com/burragec) sang a beautiful \"All'afflitto è dolce il pianto\" (_Roberto Devereux_). Her voice sounded impressively even, with an easy top range and a gorgeous, syrupy line throughout this tricky aria. I hope she finds more _bel canto_ rep to sing, since she sold me on this aria. Baritone [Clarence Frazer](https://twitter.com/clarencefrazer) indulged us with Korngold's beautiful \"Mein Sehnen, mein Wähnen\" (_Die Tote Stadt_). He showed off his rich sound and easy top, and I thought he sounded more robust than the last time I'd heard him.\n\nClarence will be singing Figaro in the Ensemble Studio's performance of _Il barbiere di Siviglia_; I'm really looking forward to seeing him in something new, where he can really show his chops ([half of Guglielmo](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=28681) in last season's _Così fan tutte_ only made me wish I'd heard him more).\n\nFinally, we heard Andrew Haji sing \"Questa o quella\" (_Rigoletto_), fresh back from cleaning up at the ['s-Hertogenbosch International Vocal Competition](http://www.ivc.nu/) (he won the Grand Prize, the Press Prize, _and_ the Jury Prize: #operahattrick). Andrew still has the agility and easy in his sound, but his voice is growing fuller, and the Verdi had him sounding really virile. He has a great presence onstage, making him instantly likeable (even as the Duke); it's so exciting to see that presence followed by truly great singing. Andrew will be singing Schumann's _Dichterliebe_ as part of the [Free Concert Series in April](http://www.coc.ca/performancesandtickets/FreeConcertSeries/April.aspx); the concert will also feature Gordon Bintner, singing Schubert's _Schwanengesang_, so you all should be there with bells on.\n\nIntern pianist [Jennifer Szeto](http://www.operademontreal.com/en/multimedia#!/jennifer-szeto-canada) played the whole concert beautifully. It's tricky to play a string of arias, each for different singers; no matter how well a pianist and singer know each other, there's always a moment of adjustment, especially in front of an audience. And no page-turner. Love it.\n\nBe sure to check out the Free Concert Series as often as you can. Each Tuesday and Thursday at noon, you can hear everything from the Vocal Series to Dance, all for free and in a beautiful space.

        "body": "Last night I went to see _Lucia di Lammermoor_ with [Opera By Request](http://operabyrequest.ca/wordpress/). It was one of those nights I often have in Toronto, where a good chunk of the cast is made up of friends and colleagues, and my curiosity was piqued to hear some of these young singers in their _Lucia_ roles. OBR does their shows in concert, and _Lucia_ is a great piece to put up in this kind of setting; the music stands on its own, after all. In some ways, _bel canto_ is better in concert; the whole point is to show off some great singing, and clearing away sets and costumes pulls the focus right to the music.\n\nOpera By Request is one of those places where you can go and hear the true up and coming talent in Toronto; it's no small thing, this Toronto talent, and it's a great thing to see solid singing coming from outside companies like the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/) and [Opera Atelier](http://www.operaatelier.com/). In the title role, soprano [Allison Cecilia Arends](http://www.allisonarends.com/) had liquid-like coloratura, and plenty of different colours in her voice. She has a stronger sound than you might imagine when you think of a Lucia, but I liked her metallic quality and the bit of heft in her sound. She had beautiful moments of soft singing as well, and really warm low register. I think Lucia is a new role for Allison, and it's a good one. She did that endless version of the Mad Scene cadenza with flautist Vicki Blechta, and she definitely had some chops to show off. I think once it settles in a bit more, she'll start to take more time with the role; there were a few moments, both dramatically and musically that felt a bit rushed to me, and with a role like Lucia, it takes a couple of of cracks to find all the room that's written in.\n\nAs Enrico, Lucia's bossy brother, baritone [Michael Robert-Broder](http://www.michaelrobertbroder.com/) was in his element. I haven't heard him in a role like this before, and it was a great fit. Michael's sound is big and broad, and he sang rolling legato phrases all through his first aria (did I mention they did _Lucia_ sans-cuts?). I especially like him as a villain-type; he has a slight tendency to let his voice get wild, and I loved it in the context of the selfish brother, sacrificing his poor little sister for some new family wealth. Michael always surprises me with his combination of power and agility; I have a feeling that he's a real budding Verdi-baritone, and Enrico is an exciting step in that direction.\n\nAs Edgardo, Lucia's lover, tenor [Paul Williamson](http://paulwilliamson.ca/) was a pleasant surprise; I haven't heard Paul sing since we were both at OperaNUOVA several years back. Some of the most difficult music in _Lucia_ is written for Edgardo, and Paul tackled it with smarts and soul. Despite a few moments where I felt he was holding his voice back slightly, Paul racked up quite the list of vocal feats over the course of the night. He sang impossibly long phrases, the kind that make you take a vicarious deep breath with the singer when they finally come up (or down) for air. He sang the freaking E-flat in the duet with Lucia, the one that's usually switched with Lucia's part, so at least the soprano is singing the E-flat and the tenor is \"only\" singing a high C (that, or the E-flat is re-written entirely). And I'll be damned if he didn't give us a high D at the very end of the piece (that's right, _at the end_ of his last scene). Even with his relentless high notes, Paul was a sensitive singer who wasn't afraid to take risks. My hat goes off to any tenor who takes on Edgardo. Mental, that tenor _bel canto_. \n\nI know this sounds weird, but I got really excited over the Raimondo, sung by bass-baritone [Nathan Keoughan](https://twitter.com/nathankeoughan). I've heard Nathan sing a bit over the last few years, most recently as Angelotti in Highlands Opera Studio's production of _Tosca_ this summer. Angelotti is a weird role to sing, but I heard some really exciting things in Nathan's voice, and I was excited to hear him sing a role that would really feature his voice. Sure enough, he sounded awesome. He has a reedy, almost throaty quality to his voice that I love; he bordered on shouting at times, and I frankly loved it. He had a beautiful evenness across his range, with gorgeous, virile sounds in the bottom and tons of power on the top. His voice seems to be moving higher, and I approve wholeheartedly.\nThe smaller roles of Alisa, Normanno and Arturo were sung respectively by [Jillian Yemen](http://oohlalaopera.wordpress.com/jillan-yemen/) and [Joseph Angelo](https://josephangelo.jux.com/), and they even doubled up on a few chorus parts as well. Jillian had a gorgeous sound, really full and rich; I hadn't heard her before, but I'd like to hear her more. Joseph was busy with two roles and plenty of tenor chorus parts; I liked him best as Arturo, Lucia's rich groom-to-be. I'd like to hear him in other stuff that's less chatty and more sing-y, where he can settle into making sound, rather than tackling the wordy sections of music written for Normanno, or the ensemble-based chorus singing.\n\nLike I said, I think _Lucia di Lammermoor_ is a great piece to choose for an in-concert setting. I thought that there could have been a few judicious musical cuts, like a couple of the recits and transitional scenes; I agree that these scenes serve to advance the plot, but without specific action onstage, these in-between bits slow down an evening that should be about showing the real stuff of the music in _Lucia_.\n\n[Click here](http://operabyrequest.ca/wordpress/) to check out what's coming up next from [Opera By Request](http://operabyrequest.ca/wordpress/). Music Director and pianist William Shookhoff has a [great concept](http://operabyrequest.ca/wordpress/?page_id=6) and environment for young singers to sing a new role in an opera of their choosing. Under those circumstances, you'll hear the real deal in rising Canadian talent, I promise you.",

        "body": "It's a fair question, isn't it? I mean, anyone who's into opera and classical music knows that the [Internet is not our friend](/online-music-is-obscuring-opera/). While there's always trusty YouTube to the rescue when you've got an urge to watch [that old Met Gala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDEOaz8v54Q&list=PL67AC3AA6E9D76C48), or Jonas Kaufmann is anything at all. But wouldn't it be _amazing_ to be able to browse an opera collection of old and new broadcasts? Especially the new. Plenty of companies broadcast or stream live performances; imagine if they all became available to watch on Netflix?\n\nI decided not to begin this post with an assumption and do some searching for opera on Netflix. I started simply, with a search for \"opera\". I got a short list of suggestions \"related to\" _The Phantom of the Opera_ (including a _Power Rangers_ movie, no joke).I tried browsing categories, trying \"Musicals\" first. Turned up stuff like _Rent_, the Shirley Jones _Carousel_, and _Fiddler on the Roof _followed closely by _South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut_, _Shrek the Musical_, and lots and lots of Bollywood. I tried the \"Music\" category, and got plenty of music documentaries, musician biopics, the complete _Ken Burns: Jazz_, and a special with Stephen Fry about being a Jew who also loves Wagner (_Wagner & Me_).\n\nSo, slim pickings. I think it's fair to say that starting now, Netflix will be a major source of media intake for anyone under the age of 25\\. Think about kids born in the last five years; they'll be part of the first generation of kids who very well may never be exposed to live theatre or music. While people of my generation and older grew up watching what was available on local television stations, today's kids will have a massive store of TV and movies that they can watch at any time. If [Victor Borge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gaKOKpGJ0s) on PBS and [_The Lawrence Welk Show_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawrence_Welk_Show) hadn't hogged the airtime for a couple of hours here and there, who knows how many people would have watched it? Basically, if opera doesn't have a place in that massive store from services like Netflix, we just might lose it in one generation.\n\nSo does Netflix, or services like it, have some sort of responsibility to provide a proper cross-section of today's visual culture? I say that because I suspect the biggest hurdle to getting plenty of opera in their collection would be convincing Netflix to provide it. I doubt that offering more opera would boost their income by much, and so it would have to be a real investment in culture, made jointly between Netflix and the opera companies themselves. It would be an amazing thing to have \"episodes\" of opera, made up of productions from the current and past seasons. You could follow seasons from Houston Grand Opera, Vienna State Opera and the Glyndebourne Festival; with enough of an operatic library built up, you could even follow specific singers, and get to know them and their careers. Bonuses like Richard Tucker Galas, or the Cardiff Singer of the World Competition could be up there too. I may be thinking idealistically, but imagine what could happen if the work of Peter Sellars, Ailyn Pérez, Robert Carsen, and Alice Coote made it into the average person's opera exposure, alongside Zeffirelli, Pavarotti and Kiri Te Kanewa. The real picture of what opera is today could be readily available to anyone who's been bored enough to browse, _deeply_, through Netflix for something new (I raise my hand, unashamed).\n\nSearching in a similar vein for opera's presence on the Internet, I checked out relevant TED Talks. There isn't much, but it's still encouraging. There's a talk about Tod Machover's \"robotic opera\" [_Death and the Powers_](http://blog.ted.com/2010/09/17/tod-machover-talks-about-his-new-robotic-opera-death-and-the-powers/), and there's [Danielle de Niese](http://www.ted.com/talks/danielle_de_niese_a_flirtatious_aria#t-33323) proving that opera can be (gasp!) sexy; there's also [this fascinating chat](http://www.ted.com/talks/charles_hazlewood) with Charles Hazlewood about the complex role of the conductor. And I think we should all [go to TED.com and nominate ](http://www.ted.com/nominate/speaker)some of the charismatic characters we know could speak well on opera in a talk entitled, _Opera: What Is It_, or _Not All Opera Singers Have Horns. _Speakers like Joyce DiDonato or Antonio Pappano or Peter Sellars would push past operatic stereotypes, and they would be perfect liaisons from the general public into the _actual_ world of opera.\n\nOf course, my idea about flooding Netflix with opera probably isn't new, and actually doing it probably has migraine-inducing hurdles attached. You'd have to convince Netflix that there's a long-term gain to be had by offering a collection of opera; on the side of the opera companies providing the productions, they might have to do some humbling negotiations for artist royalties and fees (I figure if they're basically doing opera a favour, some of the royalty fees involved in acquiring the production might be the hardest for Netflix to swallow). But it's intriguing, this idea of large Internet giants holding a certain level of responsibility for maintaining a large part of our culture. Conversely, with the possibility of opera getting dispersed throughout the general public with the same ease as television, our artists and companies might have to get comfortable with the idea of sacrificing royalty fees for the visibility. Could be humbling, but it could turn into something really exciting for opera.",

        "body": "The other day I was presented with one of those artistic conundrums that's so simple it rarely occurs to me: the question of using microphones in live opera. If you're an opera lover, your nose probably just scrunched up a little bit at the thought of Violetta sporting a headset mic. I'll make it known right away that I'm not for using microphones in a performance, and I think suggesting it is reflective of having missed the point of opera. And now I'll tell you how this all came about.\n\nI had just finished a promotional gig in a public venue, which had indeed used a sound system, both for the singers and for me at the piano. One of the listeners came up afterwards and mentioned that he was a frequent COC-goer. He had loved the use of microphones in our performance because it had made everything so easy to hear (he's right; it would have been tricky to hear acoustic singing over the noise of downtown Toronto at lunchtime). He made his case for the COC and other opera houses to start using microphones, saying that it not only would \"even out\" the balance between the singers and orchestra, but a mic-friendly opera industry might encourage more aspiring singers to try it out as a career (I know).\n\nDefensive questions kept popping into my head: \"Don't you find it thrilling enough that all that sound_ can_ happen acoustically?\" \"Why would you want it to be 'even'?\" \"Do you mean you wish live performance sounded like a studio recording?\" But the mic-friendly listener was making fair points, from the point of view of someone who obviously enjoys opera and wants to hear it more clearly. And his points are the product of a couple of unfair misconceptions about opera, the first being that opera is simply a \"way of singing\", and going to see an opera is about hearing beautiful sounds (I'll cede that the voice is opera's primary tool, but that tool isn't for its own sake; the voice is used to _tell a story_). To neutralize the balance between singers and orchestra would certainly be handy (and if it were as easy as pressing a button, I'd certainly become a bit more disposable), but operas are written for this balance to fluctuate. This fluctuation is done _on purpose _by the composer to help tell the story (think of the dramatic difference between a recit and an aria, for example). Frankly, there are some places in opera where the collective sound of voice and orchestra say even more than the singer's text. I consulted a reliable opera newbie to see if he had ever wished for better sound balance: \"I'm not listening to the singers to hear what they're saying; I'm listening to the sounds they're making in correlation to what the orchestra is playing.\"\n\nSo there's that. The second major point is regarding the idea that microphones could \"allow\" more singers to pursue opera. I fear that my argument will most likely appear as snobbery masked in technicalities, but stick with me. Simply put, if microphones had been around when opera began, its style of singing would have evolved entirely differently. The easy proof? Operetta and musical theatre. One led into the other, at the same time that the microphone was becoming a staple of live performance. The music for _The Pirates of Penzance_, _Crazy for You _and _The Last Five Years _have pretty varied singing styles, and it's not just because it's these examples come from three different centuries. It's because without microphones, the voice has to sit higher, be well-supported and stretch the boundaries of vocal resonance. With a mic, you can do a whole new list of things to tell stories (whisper, croon, speak \"naturally\", etc.), and so you can write music that more closely resembles speech (i.e. lower, shorter phrases) without balance issues. The big, resonant, almost exaggerated voice that singers use to sing opera isn't like icing on top of a musical cake. That sound is a product of using the voice efficiently in order to have the stamina to make it through the show. Loudness is not what singers strive for, and that's why giving a microphone to any eager yet unready singer won't help them sing in an opera.\n\nI imagine that trying out microphones onstage at the Four Seasons Centre might freak some people out; there may be riots and tears and there would definitely be angry opera fans shrieking about artistic blasphemy. It would be an operatic equivalent to [this experiment gone wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grOttsHuuzE). And maybe all the TV talent shows and BBC broadcasts and the Three Tenors give the public the wrong idea about how easy it is to \"do opera\" with a microphone. \"But that's different!\", you shout. And it is; we're talking about concerts in humongous venues in a non-acoustic context, versus live performances in an opera house. I personally am always a little disappointed when I'm hearing any singer through a microphone. It obscures the real sound of their voice; I want to really hear it, not to expose it to criticism, but because the various human voice timbres are something I love about opera.\n\nFrankly, the purely acoustic experience of the opera is one of the few cards we have left to play where we're not in competition with other forms of entertainment. You can hear \"loud\" all over the place. But \"loud\" doesn't hold a candle to \"human\". We get excited over acoustic covers of our favourite songs, and a show at a hole-in-the-wall bar tends to hold an energy about it that just can't be matched at a massive stadium concert. So it makes sense that an unfiltered, imperfect, superhuman (yet simply human!) performance packs a punch. Of course, we choose our battles; if singers perform in a space that's not pulling its acoustic weight, I doubt it's worth the battle to stay microphone-free. And when the acoustic stars align, we get to be ambassadors of sorts, reminding the public that there are still real, live people creating music. I think it's something in our nurture, our response to the human voice, and opera offers it up, unfiltered, at the peak of its potential. Let's not throw the technology out with the bathwater, but let's absolutely not let lose that most special tenet of opera, the voice.",

        "body": "I went to another installation of the Free Concert Series in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, to hear COC Ensemble members Iain MacNeil and Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure sing. The program was two sets of song by English composers: [George Butterworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Butterworth)'s _Six Songs from a Shropshire Lad_ and [Ivor Gurney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_Gurney#Works)'s _Ludlow and Teme_, both with texts from the 63 poems in [Alfred Edward Housman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._E._Housman)'s _A Shropshire Lad_. On its own, I'm not necessarily crazy for English song from the Great War, but both Iain and Jean-Philippe, as well as pianist Jennifer Szeto spoke about the poet and composers; I'm glad they did, because it was clear that all three of them connected with Housman's poems and their musical settings.\n\nThe concert was a beautiful, simple look at the Ensemble artists singing us some songs. Bass-baritone [Iain MacNeil](http://www.iainmacneil.com/bio) began with the Butterworth set, and it was such a treat to be able to hear him close-up and unfiltered. He took great care with these songs, enjoying the words and saying them to us with importance. He has a really gorgeous sound in his middle and lower voices, and in his top I heard some exciting changes in the sound, which is losing its slightly muscled qualities and growing bigger and more consistent. He took some beautiful risks with soft singing, too; the high, mixed-voice beginning to the final song, \"Is my team ploughing?\" took some bravery.\n\nTenor Jean-Philippe [Fortier-Lazure](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=25771) then sang Ivor Gurney's _Ludlow and Teme_, seven (mostly different) songs from _A Shropshire Lad_. These were more speech-like, with moments of lush singing tightly interwoven; they seemed tricky to sing, and it was obvious that Jean-Philippe had done his detail work. He loved the words he sang, and he sang them with his honest, easy sound. In \"Ludlow Fair\" he had some great big singing, with an obstinate and virile sound that added to the list of things that surprise me about Jean-Philippe. There were two poems that were set by both Butterworth and Gurney, and when we heard them in _Ludlow and Teme_, it served as a reminder for the listeners how two composers can set a text so differently.\n\nAt the piano, Jennifer Szeto played with that warm, meandering English-song sound. I've always felt that English song composers around this time write piano parts that are complementary to the voice, but slightly removed from the poetry; it's often less of a real-time commentary, as in German Lieder, and more various \"backdrops\" for a song's affect. Jenn had an understated autonomy in her playing, aware of the voice yet not reactive. I liked it; it was a mature balance of leading and following, all with a pretty sound.\n\nSo, it was another delightful daytime concert at the [Free Concert Series](http://www.coc.ca/performancesandtickets/FreeConcertSeries/October.aspx) in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre. Next up in the Vocal Series is _Gypsy Songs_, featuring mezzo-soprano Lauren Segal, bass-baritone Robert Gleadow (both in the current _Falstaff_), and pianist Stephen Philcox on October 23rd at noon. See you there!",

        "body": "###On the singing\n\n**Jenna: **Canadian favourite [Gerald Finley](http://www.geraldfinley.com/) in the title role was a utter pro, something you see very rarely live. Seems like an obvious thing to say when it comes to Finley, but he performs at a level which we all strive to attain, and to see it in person is a real treat. He began the night with his trademark gorgeous sound, and simply took off from there. As he sang he was a study in attention to vowels; not a sound was made without intent. When he strayed from traditional singing, he showed off the most extraordinary palate of sound I’ve ever heard live. He made gruff barks, roars, put on a lady-voice, and every imaginable affect in between. His \"Belly Aria\" nearly slayed me. You couldn’t not love him as Falstaff, the guy who’s unapologetic about his life of excess and his demands on other people. His fat suit was in that sweet spot between realistic and cartoon-like, and it was obvious light enough for Gerald to move quickly and hilariously around the stage. For my favourite Finley-tableau, I’m torn between the sight of Falstaff doing a little jig downstage left, and the beached-whale effect of his jumping poor Alice Ford.\n\n**Greg**: Gerald Finley sounds like a million bucks, and let me tell you I was more than a little pleasantly surprised to see such physical comedy chops. The fat suit, the prosthetic neck covering, heavy makeup and very physical characterizations seemed to invigorate his tone as the show went on. [Marie-Nicole Lemieux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Nicole_Lemieux) as Quickly stole my heart. A beautiful womanly contralto both physically and vocally. I was excited to hear [Simone Osborne](https://twitter.com/SimoneOsborne) as Nannetta and she nailed the Faerie Queene's aria; unfortunately I found her the most regular victim of Debus's bombastic (yet very skilled pit). [Frédéric Antoun](http://www.fr-lebureau.com/fiche_artiste.php?id=26)'s Fenton is a delight. Handsome man, beautiful tone. I could listen to him for days and totally got jealous whenever he kissed Nannetta. A free open Italianate tenor who I found had a surprising strength in his lower register. [Colin Ainsworth](http://www.colinainsworth.ca/) and [Robert Gleadow](http://imgartists.com/artist/robert_gleadow) stole every scene they entered, but matched it with some seriously top quality singing. [Lauren Segal](http://www.laurensegal.com/) as Meg brought a bright face to a dark tone and made some lovely music alongside the other ladies. Speaking of which - I need to take a moment to applaud all of them for their amazing ensemble work. I've sung Bardolfo in my summer program days, and it's not a walk in the park, I guarantee you that. Bravi, tutti!!\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429035920300/Falstaff-MC-2155.jpg)\n<figcaption>l-r: Marie-Nicole Lemieux, Lyne Fortin, Lauren Segal, Simone Osborne. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n**Jenna: **The ladies were a total hoot. As the coveted Alice Ford, soprano Lyne Fortin was another standout performance for me. She had a strong, silvery tone when she needed to use it, and could cackle and gossip with the best of them; that strength in her voice kept Alice a powerful character, and one we rooted for. Mezzo-soprano Lauren Segal was delightful partner in crime as Alice's friend Meg Page; she sang well, although appeared at times a bit stiff onstage (to be fair, the role of Meg doesn't have the same moments of fun as the other ladies). As Mistress Quickly, contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux was just a riot. She was the one who held her own beside Finley in the physical comedy department, and still she used her (gorgeous!) voice to pass off the jokes as well (Greg, didn’t you see her apply lipstick while singing a word?) Marie-Nicole was a total hit, absolutely the epitome of an unforgettable supporting character. Simone Osborne was so freaking adorable as Alice's daughter, Nannetta; Carsen really took advantage of Nannetta's youth to set her apart from the rest of the ladies, and Simone was a perfect, larger-than-life teenager. She always sings sweetly, but I lost her at times over the orchestra. Her third act aria has some pretty wicked staging; I _really_ wished Carsen hadn't put chorus members moving slowly in front of her. I'll give him kudos for keeping the production an ensemble show (it's not _just_ about her pretty singing, I get it), but it gave me music staff stress to see people continuously blocking Simone's line of sight with Johannes. We had great seats in the orchestra level, but the rings are much kinder to the sound balance in the Four Seasons Centre, and I look forward to hearing her again when I come back and sit higher up.\n\n### On the theatre of it all:\n\n**Greg: **The laurels for this one definitely are split between the deft hands of Colin Ainsworth as Bardolfo (who is kinda sexy when he's a little dirty), Robert Gleadow as Pistola, and Marie-Nicole Lemieux as Mistress Quickly. I'm a sucker for anyone who can muster up some seriously clean physical comedy, and these three do not disappoint. In fact they thrill. The character choices made by these three were exceptionally well-driven and thoroughly thought out. Lemieux's Quickly is a bright spot on stage wherever she may land. As the corpulent Falstaff, Finley is a treat. Some great mugging, with some moments of delicate sincerity layer-up to make him a real-life human being - albeit a larger-than-life one. I found Russell Braun's Ford a little to demonstrative almost to the point of overwrought. There was real anguish in his physicality during his Act 2 aria, but it wasn't matched by fire in the belly with regards to the singing. I felt it was a bit disconnected.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429036161648/Falstaff-MC-1829.jpg)\n<figcaption>l-r: Colin Ainsworth, Robert Gleadow, Gerald Finley. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n**Jenna: **The men were strong, too. Robert Gleadow and Colin Ainsworth were hilarious compulsive kleptomaniacs as Pistola and Bardolfo. I loved the cartoon-like disheveled look on both of them; they were appropriately shady with plenty of physical comedy, including two onstage wipe-outs by Gleadow, only one of which was staged (Gleadow himself confirmed this with me. Brilliant). [Michael Colvin](http://www.michaelcolvin.com/) was pushy and creepy as Dr. Caius, the guy after the young Nannetta, with just the right insistent sound. He was a perfect foil to Frédéric Antoun's Fenton, which was wide-eyed and airy and sweet. I loved Frédéric in last season's _Dialogues des Carmélites_, and it was great to hear him singing some Italian rep. He sounded fresh and happy, and he and Simone were just too darn cute as a couple onstage. As Ford, fellow Canadian fave [Russell Braun](http://www.russellbraun.com/) was perfectly uppity and easily bothered, a fantastic foil to Gerald's Falstaff. He too got covered by the orchestra at times, and it weakened him as a worth opponent to Falstaff. Russell is a great singer-actor, and he didn't skimp on the acting chops with Ford either; I loved all the sentiments, but they were often inaudible (again, looking forward to my higher-up seats later this month). Russell does win for best costume, when he's in disguise as \"Fontana\": a gold suit that screamed of New Mexico and of casinos, with the nastiest mullet I've ever seen. Loved it.\n\n### On the production:\n\n**Greg: **Great use of the entire proscenium environment. I find a lot of COC productions tend to design so far downstage it robs the audience of the grandeur that can be achieved. Also act 2, scene 2 in Ford's house is one of the more entertaining things I've seen on stage in a long time; unfortunately, what makes that scene brilliant is somewhat the downfall for act 3, scene 2\\. I loved the table dance though and I thought that was a neat way to prelude to the actual act of shaming Sir John. In the time _Merry Wives_ was written, people of the village would get together and spank or paddle the unfaithful husband in an act of public shaming. There were a few points where some of the more frenetic staging felt crowded and kind of lacked a plan.\n\n**Jenna: **I thought the production was a true spectacle, and it's not to be missed if you can manage to grab the quickly-selling tickets. [Robert Carsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Carsen)'s shows are notoriously stark and minimalistic, but his _Falstaff_ has moments of visual candy like you've never seen. Set designer Paul Steinberg built tall, almost overbearing walls grounding the sets for each scene, and he filled them with excess whenever he could swing it. Countless room-service trays laying around Falstaff's room at the inn, delicious chandeliers and dinner tables, and a too-bright, 60s-style kitchen that gets utterly _destroyed_ at the end of the second act. So many props! And when excess didn't serve the story, Carsen opted for simple without losing any comedy (the third act opens with nothing but a disheveled Falstaff making idle chat with a horse). Costume designer Brigitte Reiffenstuel was a genius throughout; I especially loved the tableau of beautiful outfits on the four ladies, especially Mistriss Quickly's jacket, with _the liner that matched her entire dress_. The final scenes with the (fantastic!) chorus were pretty spectacular to look at, with everyone wearing antlers and moving around amid the dry ice and starlight. Scenes like this are another bonus of sitting higher up in the theatre, for sure.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429036295447/Falstaff-MC-1107.jpg)\n<figcaption>A scene from Robert Carsen's Falstaff at the COC. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n<figure>\n\n### On the design:\n\n**Greg: **Mmmm... luscious teak wood and a masculine view of the Garter Inn, coupled with clean sexy mid-century lines and a muted, highly 'English' colour palette contrasts marvellously with the emerging middle class Fords/Pages/Quicklys. Bright yellows and pinks and greens liven up the stage and seem to almost get aggressive towards the end of the chase scene in Act 2 - even though if felt a bit borderline Americana, it was still a lovely transition from the warmer, darker colour of the wooden panelling of the Garter Inn. Costumes were divine, I believe Nannetta's would be my favourite, her look being a cross between Annette Funicello (Mickey Mouse Club) and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (no explanation needed).\nGuys, they eat and drink so much food and wine in this show, I found myself jealous of all the red wine being poured. Don't go hungry or thirsty unless it's for a great show and hilarious comedy.\n\n### On the music:\n\n**Jenna: **Under the baton of [Johannes Debus](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/Orchestra/JohannesDebus.aspx), the COC Orchestra sounded fresh and polished, as they usually do. My favourite musical moments all had to do with Verdi's sense of humour; the way he writes the four women laughing, the use of all the horns in the orchestra when there's mention of someone getting cuckolded, and even Falstaff's gutteral repetitions of the word, \"No\" were all brilliant and funny and just genius. I mentioned a few balance issues, but again, we were sitting in a problematic area of the theatre. What I did notice was perhaps a hesitancy from Debus to let his tempi fluctuate in order to find something more innate for the singers. There were a few moments (mostly comedic) where the singers want to move ahead; I know the slippery slope of giving an inch in tricky pieces like _Falstaff_, especially on the fly during a performance. A conductor once passed down a little gem that had apparently come from Wagner: every melody has its own tempo. There's a fine balance between rhythmic structure and organicism, and I wondered if there was more opportunity for trust between Johannes and singers. \n**Greg: **_Falstaff_ moves quickly. Unlike other Verdi masterpieces it really doesn't get much slower than an _andantino_. And the _presti_ are FAST. Unfortunately I found oftentimes the orchestra to be covering the singers a little too much (Finley and Lemieux being exceptions). The heavy brass horn work is thrilling, but in such a patter-y opera such as this beast, it can come between the audience and the hilarious text. The frenetic staging I mentioned did cause a few moments to not line up correctly, but due to the deft skill and intimate knowledge of the score the principals had, these were very short-lived. I felt the opening of Act I, scene 2 (_doppelquartett_) there were some discrepancies in what the actual tempo was, but that was quickly rectified.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\"\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429036373941/Falstaff-MC-1351.jpg)\n<figcaption>Gerald Finley as Falstaff.

        "body": "I remember working with a class of first year voice students a few years ago; I saw them all individually (totally a bad idea, switched to masterclass format the next year), and I got the sense that for a majority of these students, they were working with a vocal coach for the first time. One particularly outspoken singer asked an unexpected question during our first coaching session together: \"But, you're a pianist. Why are you telling me what to do?\"\n\nThe question was phrased like you'd expect from an 18-year old, but it's unfair to say that the question was unreasonable. So, why was I telling her what to do? The short answer: because I know how to help her sing better. But the student's question was about how I, a pianist with no useful singing skills, knew how to talk about the voice. I'll give you one more short answer before I elaborate: I know how to talk about the voice because I've heard tons of them.\n\nIt's a common story with a few variables: a young pianist heads off to some form of post-secondary education or internship, and realizes quickly that beyond the realm of Nocturnes and Sonatas, there's an endless amount of music written for Piano and Something Else. The young pianist is forced/invited/bribed to join some sort of chamber ensemble to get a credit in school, and she realizes that playing with other people is super fun and it makes her a better musician.\n\nPianists who decide to work with singers do so largely by playing regular voice lessons, and here's where I get to answer that student's question from years ago. It's in these countless hours of playing voice lessons that pianists become coaches (if they're paying attention). They learn to identify what it sounds like when a singer is pressing on the voice, or under-supporting, or clenching their jaw, or holding their breath, or when they're out of tune and why. And as pianists work for more and more technically developed singers, they get the real treat of hearing what it sounds like when a voice is supported well and free from tension; I'll spoil it for all you and tell you that it sounds thrilling.\n\nBut wait, don't singers also go through countless hours of voice lessons? How come a coach is considered the authority? Simply put, we went to more lessons than singers did. To be fair, we often aren't there for the first 30 minutes, which is when the real technical nitty-gritty goes down between teacher and student. But once the pianist arrives, the lesson is about putting the last half hour's technical improvements into the aria you're trying to sing. The pianist gets to sit in on this process over and over, learning the semantics used by voice teachers and hearing the results in real time from the singer. Even in between these weekly lessons, young coaches are forced into a sort of accelerated Opera 101 course in order to stay afloat with all the new music in front of them. We learn about _da capo_ arias and voice types and the point of _bel canto_ and German and whether it's the high or the low key.\n\nSimply put, pianists have quantity on their side. Quantity of voice lessons to watch, arias to learn (and learn about), and even quantity of vocal \"case studies\". Let me explain that last one: many specific technical or musical hurdles that come up in coaching sessions fall under broad categories, like \"breath\" or \"rhythm\". A coach learns what these are by hearing lots of so-called \"case studies\"; once you've heard a few singers learn the difference between singing legato and not, you start to hear the mechanics of the voice, like listening beyond someone's timbre and into their technique. It really is all about listening. A coach is a really educated set of ears for a singer, not a replacement for a voice teacher. In fact, with a good singer, a coach can do their job simply by telling that singer what they hear, with no need for a follow-up suggestion; the singer takes what they've learned with their teacher and applies it to the issues that the coach hears.\n\nAnd in the meantime, the coach is still a pianist, and he'll hopefully notice how working with singers has helped his idea of rhythm, of legato, and even musical imagination. The formidable Martin Katz said in an [interview](http://www.examiner.com/article/interview-with-pianist-martin-katz), \"You must really sing something when you’re playing, differently from when you’re playing Sonata No. 2 or Etude No. 3\\. The minute there is a word involved, one’s imagination is electrified in some way, and for me, the whole joy is not just playing the notes, but what the words are saying, what they mean, what they suggest. Somebody who’s not interested in telling stories in their playing should be advised to not do it. If your partner’s telling a story and you’re not, what’s the point?\"",

        "body": "Opera singers are masters of multi-tasking: they juggle an important list of technical elements in order to sing a performance, and they have to do it in foreign languages, while following a conductor and negotiating weird costumes/lighting/staging. Singers' to-do lists don't get simpler as they gain experience. Once there's a decent consensus amongst the opera industry that a singer is established, there's a weird phenomenon that occurs. The singer begins to pick up followers, hangers-on of a parasitic sort. These new companions are usually people who aren’t opera singers, but are really into opera for one reason or another. Voice teachers, coaches, audition consultants, agents, and even donors like to latch onto a successful singer (even better if they’re a young up-and-comer). They’re like really swanky groupies. So why do they cling to opera singers? Simply put: they want to vicariously live the perceived glam life.\n\nIn the case of donors (those sponsoring singers’ fees, in particular), I have realized that most of them do it because they really do love opera and the fascinating singers in the industry. But I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the guaranteed social scene that comes with it. Think about it: if you can afford to sponsor a singer like Gerald Finley or Ben Heppner, you inevitably buy face time with someone famous. And if you buy enough face time, you eventually get to know the famous opera singer better than most. This kind of stuff comes in handy when you go to other opera parties and someone brings up Finley or Heppner and you can say things like, “Oh yeah, he loves his eggs over-medium” or “Our dog simply adores him”. There’s something about it that rubs me the wrong way, because these donors simply aren’t usually there for the true part of an opera singer’s work. They’re not there with them in the practice room, or the first sing-through of a piece, or schlepping through an audition tour across Europe. They’re not there for the moments of non-glamour that grossly outweigh the onstage moments of high notes and taking bows. So when even well-meaning donors tag along for the icing portion of the opera singer’s job, the term \"fair-weather friend\" comes to mind.\n\nA more puzzling culprit is the new presence of audition consultants in the young-artist circuits. The premise is great; someone who is well-connected and in touch with the current opera industry offers educated advice to young singers beginning their careers. I’ve [written before](/in-defence-of-singers/) about the mysterious psychology of audition etiquette. When a singer does well on an audition tour, winning decent roles at respectable houses, the audition consultant can often insinuate that his advice was what did the trick. As harmless as this reaction may be (as a coach, I understand the personal elation of being able to help a student succeed), it suggests that winning auditions is really about having added that last aria, or having one's hair a proper length. It ignores the defining factor of auditions in general: great singing. Like the donors, the audition guru simply isn't there for all the work.\n\nPerhaps the most ubiquitous examples of self-elected singer sidekicks come from within the industry, and these are people who should know better. Voice teachers and coaches are intimately involved in a singer's progress, and they really do get to know the singers well. From my position the industry, I've seen it at more than one major institution: teachers and coaches who claim propriety of their star singers. It shows up in weird ways, mostly jealously when those teachers and coaches find out their star singer has worked with...wait for it..._someone else_. It usually is a testament to the singer's hard work and accomplishment that they have a mentor with attachment issues; and even if those teachers and coaches were large parts of the process, it's silly for them to assume there's nothing for a student to learn from another set of ears.\n\nIt may be naïve to imagine the industry without this phenomenon. It's one of the perks of being a pianist within in the opera world; you get to see the work a singer does, and you get to sit in on much of their instruction. Pianists and coaches often have the most context for a singer's process, and it's off-putting to hear them receive isolated pieces of advice from those who check in only occasionally. When you spend plenty of time around opera singers, you oddly start to imagine that you too are capable of doing what they do (you can't); I think that's the position from which a lot of singers' advice comes. So, if these singer sidekicks really just want to take a bow, they had better practice their scales.",

        "body": "On Wednesday, October 15th I made my way on over the Four Seasons Centre at University and Queen Street West to check out the [Canadian Opera Company](http://www.coc.ca/Home.aspx)'s production of [_Madama Butterfly_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/MadamaButterfly.aspx) by Giacomo Puccini (duh, Greg.)\nLet me preface this by saying one thing: the music is beautiful, the story is not. I don't have the emotional, visceral attachment to this piece that other people have. I can't explain why - well, actually I can, but that's a completely different piece for another time here at Schmopera.\n\nSo the story... American Soldier Benjamin Franklin (B. F.) Pinkerton comes to Japan aboard the _Abraham Lincoln_ and somehow finds himself leasing a house atop a hill in Nagasaki for 999 years (luckily, in Japan he has the option to cancel at anytime). He's also set to marry a young geisha (another contract he can cancel at anytime) from the village Cio-Cio San, called Butterfly. Goro, the wedding/real estate/gossip broker has arranged the deal and is showing Pinkerton his new house, when Sharpless, the American consul in Nagasaki shows up to try and talk some sense into Pinkerton. He learns the intended bride is only fifteen years old and registers proper \"western\" disgust at the idea (which librettists Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica deftly juxtapose against Butterfly's own statement that she is 'past her prime' at a whopping fifteen years old.) The wedding happens in a blitz and we discover that Cio-Cio San has decided to convert to Christianity for her husband, forsaking her family and heritage. Unfortunately for her, her secret trip to the monastery was discovered, and now she's on the receiving end of an entire familial shunning. Obviously not what she had intended. The family storms off/are removed by Pinkerton and the mood changes quickly to that of trying to convince a young teenage girl to consummate a marriage. Which... happens.\n\nIn the second act we see Butterfly and Suzuki, her maid, buzzing about the house with Suzuki trying to talk sense into Butterfly. It's been three years since Pinkerton sailed on the _Lincoln_ back to America, and there's been no contact at all. Suzuki is trying to make her realize he probably isn't coming back - just as Sharpless comes to deliver a letter saying EXACTLY that. Upon seeing Butterfly's excitement of Pinkerton's return (the _Lincoln_ has been spotted in the harbour by her and Suzuki), and watching her refuse the advances of a wealthy Yamadori, he doesn't have the heart to tell her that Pinkerton won't see her. He relents and shows up after Butterfly stays awake all night in vigil waiting for him. Upon greeting Suzuki and hearing of the grief it will cause Butterfly, Pinkerton runs off saying I'm a coward leaving Sharpless and Kate Pinkerton (B. F.'s American wife) to deal with the fallout and collect the child. After relinquishing her son, Sorrow, Cio-Cio San takes her own life, using the same blade her father committed suicide with at the demand of the Mikado. She expires as we hear Pinkerton wailing \"Butterfly!!\" in the distance.\n\nSo that's the story... here's what I thought.\n\nFrom a design perspective, [Susan Benson](http://susanbensonart.com/design/)'s set is typically \"Japanese\" with the standard sliding doors set up that are key to the opening of the piece. Set on a raked stage (higher upstage than down) to add perspective and clear sight lines in large crowds. I get the feeling of the whole colour palette being washed out by the sun. It gives the air of the former glory of Cio-Cio San's family's wealthier days, but showing the passage of time can be harsh on anything, not just a person's face. My eyes craved a shock of colour here and there. We get a bit when the wealthy Yamadori arrives. The lighting was simple and effective with the only real \"effect\" happening during Butterfly's vigil.\n\nThere aren't many different ways you can present _Madama Butterfly_. Luckily the music is lush, complex and Puccini. The show starts off at a clip with Goro ([Julius Ahn](http://www.juliusahn.com/)) ably running about the stage ordering the supers, who were assembling the set (a series of movable walls with sliding rice paper slats) to represent the house. A snafu with the set assembly gave us a chance to see why good [comprimarios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprimario) are so important. While the supers were fixing the tech issue _a vista_ (in full view of the audience) and the scene is clearly underway, Ahn deftly added some improvised staging and gestures all the while staying on top of his connection with the conductor and orchestra. It's one of the myriad of things I love about live theatre, seeing a professional solve a problem in real time. Bravo, Mr. Ahn.\n\nEnter the Americans... ugh. *\n\nTo be fair, Pinkerton ([Stefano Secco](http://www.stefanosecco.com/)) has the dubious distinction of having is ulterior motives, and unsavoury plot known to the audience from the get-go. He's about to use, abuse, and discard Cio-Cio San, although thanks to Giacosa and Illica he says it a little more poetically than I. I saw a distaste for American culture that's inherent in the dialogue of both Pinkerton and Sharpless ([Dwayne Croft](http://imgartists.com/artist/dwayne_croft)). Secco's tenor is lovely, italianate, open, free and quite muscular in the extreme upper registers - great for Puccini. I felt like he wasn't actually connecting emotionally with what he was saying. I do believe there's a time and a place for presentational theatre, but I felt like he spent most of his time poorly negotiating the proscenium arch and the fourth wall. As an actor I believe it's impossible to connect with the other characters in your universe if there's no genuine eye contact. You're not communicating otherwise, and I felt that a lot with this Pinkerton. However is gruffness and dare-I-say rudeness when he's inspecting the house at the top of the show, did add a more believable layer to him when it came to kicking the family out and then later when he lasciviously can only focus on getting Butterfly into the sack for a little makin' whoopee. I felt the darker vowels tended to get swallowed in the back of the throat, but for the most part it sailed out quite easily over the orchestra.\n\nAs Sharpless I found Croft's voice a little too _cupo_. It has a beautiful, natural colour and texture that reminds me of the whiskey his character imbibes on stage, but instead of getting a 15-yr-old scotch I feel like I got a decent Bourbon. It's great and all, but didn't have the 'bite' or the 'ping' I was looking for. The swagger and characterization he brought to the American consul was wonderful, despite the fact that I felt he may have been a bit uncomfortable performing on a raked stage. I found his tone lovely, open and free with just the right amount of age-colouring to make you believe him, yet when paired with Secco, I found his tone to retreat into the back of his throat a bit as well. He wore a GREAT suit, though...\n\nAs Goro, I have to doff my cap to [Mr. Ahn](http://www.juliusahn.com/). Flying around that stage, singing some very pattery dialogue and singing with a light, free, and open tenor that had an agility that sparkled on the few runs and flourishes Puccini gave him. Suzuki's assault is a full-on physical attack, executed in such a complete physicality that it makes me excited for the future of opera if our comprimarios (like in [_Falstaff_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/Falstaff.aspx)) are doing such excellent stage/character/physical work while still providing beautiful singing.\n\nSpeaking of Beautiful singing, can we all just take a moment for [Elizabeth DeShong](http://www.elizabethdeshong.com/)?\n\n... Thanks.\n\nHoly crap I loved her. I feel like I know want to see all of _Butterfly_ only from Suzuki's perspective. Less naïve than her counterpart Butterfly, she lets us see that in her physical stance, her physiognomy, and voice all lend a credible level of worldliness and you really feel and see and empathize with her desire to protect Cio-Cio San. Her voice is full and luscious with a low register that tickles me in fun places. Her shifts from ecstatic happiness alongside Cio-Cio San to her rage at discovering Goro gossiping about Butterfly's son, Sorrow, show a talented actress who can also act with her voice. During Act III, she's a wonder. Her emotional journey is a roller-coaster and it's the first time I really felt Suzuki's stake in all this. The few moments where I was on the verge of tears, they were at the hands of her deft work on the stage.\n\nAnd then there's [Patricia Racette](http://patriciaracette.com/).\n\nMs. Racette is [widely lauded](http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Madama-Butterfly-review-Patricia-Racette-lifts-5556813.php) for her portrayal of Butterfly, and I can totally see why. A beautifully nuanced, full, visceral, lyric soprano that had true excitement in her pianos as well as her fortes. Her management of the naïveté of young teenager as well as the manic mood swings we were all known for added much needed depth to Cio-Cio San who really spends almost the entire show on stage after her Act I entrance. The role and the singer are each a _tour de force_ and I recommend any time you get the chance to hear Racette sing Puccini - do it. Tasteful portamenti, respect for tempi, as well as an elastic, organic use of rallentando remind us why we like Puccini in the first place.\n\nUn Bel Di was breathtaking. #fullstop.\n\nThe chorus was excellent ,and the humming chorus lived up the the anticipation I had built up in my mind for it. Bravi, tutti!!\n\nFor me the highlight definitely had to be the COC orchestra under [Patrick Lange](http://www.artistsman.com/home/kuenstler_verzeichnis/dirigent/patrick-lange/)'s (#tripleswoontimesinfinity) masterful hand. The blend in the strings and the seamless passing of melody from winds to strings married perfectly for this schmaltzy, movie-music kind of score. With wonderful quotes of Americana during act I and the suspense of the ostinato timpani in Act III. Most of the time, it looked as though Lange and his orchestra were dancing together. All bodies and music moving at the same time in the same direction was really quite something to experience. Bravi tutti.\n\nSo in short, if you like _Butterfly_, you'll love this production. Clean, forward, traditional. If you don't like _Butterfly_, go see it for Racette, DeShong, and the orchestra. You will not be disappointed.\n\nHonourable Mention to Jennifer Szeto and Jenna Douglas (of [Schmopera](http://schmopera.com/)) rocking some serious [birdcalls](/birdcalls-and-spoilers/) at the top of Act III. * - in reference to the American characters in the opera, not Americans in general.",

I wandered around with my camera clicking, and got a few great shots to share. Enjoy!",

        "body": "### Why do you sing?\n\n I’ll borrow the words of Georgia O’Keeffe, and say, “Singing has always seemed to me the most perfect means of expression...”. I began studying music, as a pianist. While I loved, and still love, playing the piano, it became very clear to me that I needed to be my own instrument. I wanted to express myself with notes, words, and my entire being. On stage, I can be anyone... I can scream, cry, laugh, change gender, die, love... The limits of everyday life are removed. I’ll have lived many lives when my career as a singer ends. \n\n### Who is Suzuki?\n\n Suzuki is love personified. When the whole world turns against Butterfly, Suzuki stays by her side. She takes what is good and nurtures it, she tempers a new, harsh reality with normalcy, and she pleads for privacy when tragedy is just around the corner. Her devotion isn’t a financial arrangement, it doesn’t make sense, it will cause her pain, and yet, she wouldn’t have it any other way. She knowingly accepts vulnerability. It is easy to focus on romantic love and it’s joys and sorrows, but the real love that is so hard to find and give, is consistently present throughout the opera in Suzuki.\n\n### Suzuki spends much time onstage listening and reacting to the other characters. What's dramatically challenging about this?\n\n All of Act 1 is about giving and receiving energy and intention, for Suzuki. You have to build a connection to Butterfly, establish your place in the household, project your understanding of the story that is unfolding, and all of this has to be accomplished without the aid of sung text. As you perform a role more and more, the challenge that you have to keep ever-present in your mind, is to always hear everything for the first time. You have to remind yourself at the top of each show that you don’t know what is about to happen. That simple, little reminder helps to keep all of the interactions fresh. \n\n### Why do you think _Madama Butterfly_ is such a staple in the operatic canon?\n\n I think people are drawn to extremes. We go to the theater to see life ‘elevated’. _Madama Butterfly_ takes feelings that we are all familiar with, like love, loss, friendship, betrayal, etc., unites them with a lush orchestral undercurrent, and takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride unlike any other. \n\n### What kind of relationship do you have with roles you’ve done more than once (Suzuki, Rosina, Hänsel, Cenerentola)?\n\n There are pros and cons to being “comfortable” in a role. Certainly, you gain a more thorough understanding of your character and the music through repetition, but you have to be careful to keep your choices fresh and not just recycle ideas that have worked in the past. The other fun thing that happens is that, I find, the characters kind of live on and grow along side of me as I learn and gain experience in my everyday life. When the time comes to sing one of these characters again, that learning shows itself in new vocal colors or character reactions. \n### What roles would you love to sing (realistically or not)?\n\n At this point, I think I’m ready to give Cio-Cio San a try! I’m only half kidding. Realistically, I’m keen to sing Lucretia in Britten’s _The Rape of Lucretia_, as well as, Dalila in Saint-Saëns’ _Samson et Dalila_.\n\n### If you didn’t sing, what else would you do?\n\n I’ve been on this path since I was a teenager, so it is hard to picture my life any other way. That said, if I completely changed course, I think I might like to own an antique store. Seeking out little oddities from the past is a hobby of mine.",

        "body": "I worked on the COC's production of _Madama Butterfly _(the final show is [tonight](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/MadamaButterfly.aspx)), and it was a chance for me to see a perfect example of artistic individuality. The twelve-show run at the Four Seasons Centre was shared by two almost entirely different leading casts, save for Elizabeth DeShong as Suzuki. Opera fans know well that different singers bring variety to roles, especially those deeply explored roles like Cio-Cio San. So when I was able to, in the time and place, watch two groups of singers embody one group of characters, it was like a candy shop for my natural singer-curiosity.\nThe really interesting part about watching different artists perform a role is that the differences aren't always within the singer's control. Granting the usual process of making dramatic decisions based on the score, there are inevitably elements of a character that are extensions of the singer playing the role. For those of you who were lucky enough to see the title role sung by both Patricia Racette and Kelly Kaduce, it was glaringly clear that Cio-Cio San is no caricature. Patricia brought strength and benevolent stubbornness to Butterfly, and it broke our hearts to see her finally admit she had been wrong about Pinkerton. Kelly Kaduce, on the other hand, took advantage of her own youthful, almost carefree demeanour. That broke our hearts too, because the shock of the Act III action seems to hit the teenaged Cio-Cio San out of the blue. Two different tragedies are told using one libretto, and that's just irresistible to watch unfold in the rehearsal room.\n\nIt's not the first time that COC audiences have had the chance to hear a role sung by two different singers (_Rigoletto_, _Tristan und Isolde_, and most [COC Ensemble Studio performances](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BarberOfSeville/EnsembleStudioPerformance.aspx), to give examples), but I think seeing two singers' takes on Cio-Cio San is a prime example of the individuality that exists in opera. As with a lot of Puccini roles, much of the character's mysteries are already solved; it's clear who/where/when they are, and their character's choices are, for the most part, explained explicitly. Perhaps you could argue that Puccini characters aren't as interesting as, say, Salome or Blanche, but I think roles like Tosca or Cio-Cio San help separate the men from the boys, so to speak.\n\nThink about it: when the show is created in a real-time, real-life environment a good director knows that a \"concept production\"just isn't gonna fly. I remember a smart director ([Paul Curran](http://www.paulcurrandirector.com/) for the curious) saying to our _Tosca _team before beginning rehearsals something like, \"The best way to do _Tosca _is, you know, to just _do Tosca_.\" This might seem like it makes everyone's work easier, but it's really the opposite. Singers can't rely on stylistic idioms or suspended disbelief to tell the story; they're faced with a libretto that gives a real-time scene (i.e. Acts II & III in _Butterfly_), and a score that extends the drama to its operatic scale. Basically, there's conversation music and thinking music, and that's harder to do in an opera that presents a story in a real environment; a Cio-Cio San is responsible for making a specific link between Puccini's music and any waiting time between characters' lines. When there's no concept to give you dramatic license between actual lines of text, you're left with finding out what's _true_ about a character, and that's trickier than you'd think.\n\nJust as a director is left only with the tools of building character relationships in pieces like _Butterfly_, the singer is faced with creating, at the very least, an organic character. The fact that a role like Cio-Cio San, created in one of these \"real\" environments, is a testament to the work of Puccini and the libretto by Giacosa and Illica. Of course, we owe our experience to artists like Kaduce and Racette for finding something in common between Butterfly and themselves. On the long list of fascinating things I see at work, watching two pros embody one role will stay near the top, I'm sure.",

        "body": "### On the singing\n\n**Jenna**: I thought the singing was fantastic from the four leading ladies (lady singers, with variable genders). In the title role, soprano [Meghan Lindsay](http://www.meghanlindsay.com/) was fierce and manipulative; she made use of her warm, velvety middle range, and let her high notes rip with metallic ring. Alcina is a role that features lots of disingenuousness, and I thought Meghan made a clear distinction between Alcina's moments of honesty and her moments of lies. Very Queen-like. As Ruggiero, Alcina's lover-du-jour, mezzo-soprano [Allyson McHardy](http://www.allysonmchardy.com/) was spectacular. I've gotten to know Allyson's singing a bit over the years, and it's always a treat to hear her in Handel; it's really her thing. Allyson is a pro when it comes to pants roles, and Ruggiero was no exception. She had fantastic coloratura and stunning, still rendition of \"Verdi prati\". She sang with an honest, manly sound, and she paced her vocal colour palate wisely; she created a Ruggiero who really \"spoke\" differently to Alcina than to his lost-now-found fiancée, Bradamante. Speaking of whom, mezzo-soprano [Wallis Giunta](http://wallisgiunta.com/site/) showed off some seriously polished singing as Ruggiero's fiancée (who is at times dressed as a man, to give the pants role confusion another layer). She had incredible coloratura in a few damn-difficult arias, and I loved how she smartly used her chest voice to deal with the role's low writing. I liked that she ornamented her _da capos_ to show off her higher range, keeping Bradamante a lighter \"male\" foil to Ruggiero.\nBut as Morgana, the girl with the shortest attention-span ever, soprano [Mireille Asselin](http://www.mireilleasselin.com/) stole the show. She sounded flawless, with seemingly endless creative possibilities in her voice. Mireille is an Early Music pro as well, and she gave a lesson in how to ornament an aria; starting purely from her voice, she didn't let a word go by without a specific interpretation. Morgana had the precious few moments of comedic relief during the show, and her hilarious staging of \"Tornami a vagheggiar\" is now officially the New and Improved Coat Aria (go see it, you'll agree). Also, she plays a mean air-harpsichord.\n\nIn the two supporting roles were [Krešimir Špicer](http://operabase.com/a/Kresimir_Spicer/9872) (Oronte) and [Olivier Laquerre](http://www.olivierlaquerre.com/mb/index.php) (Melisso). Melisso doesn't really show off a singer's voice (it's mostly recit); I'd have liked a bit more voice in the recits, rather than a _parlando_ effect most of the time, but I don't know the role well enough to preach. Krešimir had a beautiful tenor sound with lots of sensitivity; much of the time, however, I didn't get the chance to really hear his voice. He was almost too affective with his sound, getting into off-the-voice or shouting territory. When he showed a beautiful legato in his last aria, I was left wondering why I didn't get to hear it more.\n\n**Greg**: This is the good stuff. Come see this show for the singing and the rest is delicious, delicious gravy - it can even be a miso gravy for the veggie-types.\n\nTo say the growth I've heard in Megan Lindsay's voice over the last four years is exciting would be an understatement. Alcina is her role through and through. The comfort in her middle range coupled with crystal-clear diction added an incredible depth of colour when she went into the top end of her vocal line. Her aria at the top of Act II was breathtaking. It was probably the most quiet that the excited opening-night crowd had been the whole evening. Her cadenzas were lovely and she commanded quite a dramatic range in the versatility of her vocal colour. I hope she's as excited about this as I am. Mezzo Allyson McHardy was on fire. This Handel stuff was made for her. She had some incredibly tricky music and it was all delivered with skill, grace, and a genteel masculinity that proves the mettle of a true pants-role singer. Her dark tone and quick vocal action glid through the melismas effortlessly - I swear, girl didn't even break a sweat. Speaking of pants roles, Mezzo Wallis Giunta reminded us why we love her so much. Her deft navigation between head voice and chest, vocal lines that seemed to last forever, and delicate switches between the male Ricciardo and the female Bradamante. Giunta and McHardy together? I died. I'm dead now. To round out the quartet of astounding female singers we were privileged to hear Mireille Asselin's Morgana. You should be too. Seriously, get a ticket. She opens the show and from that point, any moment she steps on stage you're glued to her. In the dark at one point, I literally just wrote \"Tornar!!!!\" Yes, four exclamation points. Her ornaments, her cadenzas, her vocal line, her dramatic drive behind the text informing her voice, it was all just brilliant. Granted, her character is probably the most fun to play, but the music is incredibly difficult and it is no match for Asselin. Krešimir Špicer sang Oronte with a masculine line and an easy tone. I felt his upper range got spread and bordered on \"yell-y\" which can be a byproduct of the frenzied nature of the staging. Later in the show he delivered a lovely aria with a clean legato that made me with I'd heard more of it throughout the show. Similarly with Olivier Laquerre's Melisso, who unfortunately (I'm pretty sure) only sings recits during scenes with fairly high emotional stakes. I think the drama of the scene didn't afford Laquerre the chance to sing the lovely lines we're used to. That being said, Laquerre seemed the most at ease with the quick pace of the staging.\n\n### On the production\n\n**Jenna**: Alright, a disclaimer: the notable Opera Atelier aesthetic isn't my cup of tea. But I'll say that [Artistic Directors](http://www.operaatelier.com/about/creative-team/) Marshall Pynkoski (director) and Jeannette Lajeunesse-Zingg (choreographer) succeeded in creating an _Alcina_ full of stunning tableaus. There were beautiful and varied sets by [Gerard Gauci](http://debellefeuille.com/gauci-gerard-2/) and gorgeous costumes by [Michael Gianfrancesco](http://www.catalysttcm.com/michaelgianfrancesco.html), complemented by film projections by [Ben Shirinian](http://benshirinian.com/). There were floating harpsichords and gorgeous sky-blue fabric panels and dizzying stars. My issues come from the sense that, similarly to the music itself, this _Alcina_ was not directed using the text as a primary source. During the first act alone there were at least four _da capo_ arias where the return of the A section was delivered directly to the audience. This breaking of the fourth wall is really effective when it works with the text of the aria. But four wall-breaking _da capos_ in a row are a good way to show that not every aria is equal in affect. I'm a big believer in subtext as motivation for repeated text, especially in Handel arias. But there's something to be said for taking a score literally, at least as a starting point.\nI had a feeling that Pynkoski prioritized the use of these dramatic tools over whether or not they were actually applicable to the scene. You could argue that there was indeed one visual theme throughout the show: naked guys. So many naked guys. I get it: Alcina is a nymphomaniacal queen who enslaves her lovers for her own private use. So I get the scattering of nude male bodies around the stage, or projected across a screen, or acting as Alcina's coffee table. But as the images of male nudes was used again and again, I couldn't shake my initial feeling of gratuitousness. Granted, Pynkoski cracked a joke about gratuitous nudity before the show began, but subtlety can go a long way. I mean, at one point in the third act, when Alcina's enslaved men are freed, the film projection shows a _deluge_ of naked men and their great butts flying past in resurrected ecstasy. I'm not saying it was the ugliest thing I ever saw (quite the opposite), but again, this _Alcina_ pushed its dramaturgical tool almost to a laughable point.\n\n**Greg**: The staging is something new for Atelier. Unlike Jenna, I really enjoy the Pynkoski/Lajeunesse-Zingg aesthetic. It's a niche that Toronto deserves to have filled, and they fill it incomparably. I've noticed a depature from tradition with Atelier recently (bringing in later rep like _Der Freischutz_ and this year they're doing Berlioz) and I felt this lovely production was the first in a foray in exploring new modern techniques for the theatre to reinvigorate a several hundred year old score. It's a great idea and most of it ran successfully, however I felt a few glitches. The show starts as a meta play with dancers warming up and a cameo by the two Assistant Stage Managers. A great use of Handel's overture and a great way to get the ball rolling, however, they don't ever close the envelope of metatheatricality. We never see \"the players\" again as players and I think that's important for metatheatre to be successful. I'm always a little disconcerted when a director gets up and apologizes to the audience during the pre-amble, but it was a funny pre-amble so I gave Marshall the benefit of the doubt - and maybe I'm a total libertine, but I really don't think you need to warn an audience for nudity, if you see neither breasts nor genitalia. But it is nice to see men being objectified for a change. The design was striking. In looking at it, I felt like Dali was paying his respects to Bosch. The incorporation of Shirinian's projections worked great in assisting the audience in seeing how the whole island is cursed and transmutated former lovers. The costumes were lovely period numbers, with soft sparkly silks and crinolines for the ladies and burnished coppers and green-browns for the men. Here's where I felt the disconnect. I felt the traditional costumes were a little TOO traditional to jive with a much more modernized set and technical design. It could be argued that the disjunct effect lends to the \"weirdness\" of Alcina's enchanted isle, but it just caused me to only look at one or the other and rarely the whole picture. We get members of the Tafelmusik orchestra flown in from the ceiling, and playing from the boxes (in short, out of the pit) and I LOVED IT. It added a depth of colour to Handel's score that you really only get to hear when it's done on period instruments by players of the calibre of Tafelmusik. The characters fly around the stage quite quickly and while singing some darn difficult music. They were graceful, I can't deny them that, but I felt it robbed the show of just a touch of its elegance. I'm not entirely sure why the majority of the _da capo_ sections were done breaking the fourth wall and singing directly to us in the audience. While I thank Marshall for giving us the opportunity to hear some unencumbered beautiful singing, but it didn't seem like they were dramatically motivated. As a gay man, I was in no way put off by the barrage of naked men.\n\n### On the acting\n\n**Jenna**: I thought Mireille shone as an actor in this _Alcina_; she found the most organic way to transition between dramatic beats or to use sections of instrumental music to her advantage. Allyson and Wallis were great in their pants (and sometimes skirt) roles; Allyson came across very stoic and convincing in her male postures, and Wallis tackled the tricky character of Bradamante in and out of both genders. I sort of wanted more of a noticeable change when Bradamante reveals herself to be Ruggiero's lost (female) fiancée; but it struck me that her music remains masculine, suggesting a tomboyish character, so I'll hand it to Wallis for using Handel's score for character motivation. For the most part, much of the acting was seen from within the parameters of the particular aesthetic of Opera Atelier productions. Many of the dramatic decisions weren't coming from the text itself, and it made me wonder about the singers' own ideas about their characters' journeys throughout _Alcina_.\n\n**Greg**: Remember when I said there was a time and a place for presentational theatre? This is that time and place. Staying true to the era, the physicalization of the characters is done in a demonstrative manner leaving the voice to be the part of the actor's instrument (body) to provide the emotional colour palette. When it's done well, it's remarkable - and this was remarkable. Lindsay's Alcina easily swung between dangerous viper and sweet fluffy-bunnykins. What was really engaging was when her heart breaks. Lindsay's vocal colours changed ever so slightly and as Alcina spirals out of control, you hear more desperation and loss. It was an astounding journey to watch someone take. Asselin's Morgana had the desperately needed comic relief duty in the show. Her fickleness and flightiness yet sincere, intense feelings remind me of a young, magical, female, Don Giovanni. She genuinely loves almost any man she meets. She was lithe and agile and spritely and never once at the cost of her incredibly beautiful singing. As Ruggiero, McHardy was at ease in a soldier's boots. She commanded the role and not once did it feel like an affectation. The moment of reunion with Bradamante made me a little misty, I'm not going to lie. Giunta, known well for her work in pants roles, takes it one step further actually playing a woman pretending to be her brother. There were moments when Lindsay and McHardy were doing some fabulous singing stage right and I was hopelessy glued to Giunta on stage left as she struggled to hide Bradamante's emotions behind the veil of Ricciardo. It was great stuff. I actually quite enjoyed Spicer's characterization of Oronte. He played the part of a man with a wounded ego but wouldn't let the spark die from his eye. He was quite charming.\n\n### On the music\n\n**Jenna**: Under the baton of [David Fallis](http://www.music.utoronto.ca/Page2353.aspx), the [Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra](http://www.tafelmusik.org/) sounded fantastic, as I expected them to be. I always love hearing the difference between period and modern instruments, and there's always a moment of musical novelty that hits me when Tafelmusik begins to play. I thought there were some musical moments that could have had more spice; I wasn't always convinced that Maestro Fallis was conducting with the text in mind.\n\n**Greg**: The orchestra for the run is the inestimable Tafelmusik under the baton of Maestro David Fallis. The tempi were spot-on and he kept a melodic line and pace that allowed the singers to have comfort with the devilish coloratura. I noticed no balance issues whatsoever. One of my favourite things about this era in music, is the composers' use of silence between notes, and Tafelmusik understands better than anyone, coupled with period instruments, that's what gives this entire piece its Baroqueness - when they let the silence sing too. In this piece the orchestra and ballet actually spend quite a bit of time at the forefront so we're treated to some extended instrumental interludes and dances. The minuets were graceful and smooth and the final Tamburino was thrilling. The offstage chorus, what little they were used, sang well. They handled the chorales extremely well. I found their counterpoint got a little muddled in the one fugal section, but diction was clear and precise and they had a strong inner-voice section.\n\n### On the dancing\n\n**Jenna**: I'll say the Atelier Ballet looked beautiful, and now I hereby cede all dance comments to Greg, who actually knows what he's talking about.\n\n**Greg**: OOOOOoooooo!!!! I get to talk about dance!!! YAY!!! The Ballet of Opera Atelier are wonderful in this show. Handel wrote a lot of instrumental music specifically for a Ballet into the score and Atelier makes full use of that. The women danced with a poise and an elegance that when thrown against some of the more gratuitous content of the show, was what kept the piece from spiralling downward into offensive (to be fair there were only a couple moments where I thought \"Okay, that's a little too much even for me.\" They were few and far between but they could have been dangerous). Supported lines, relaxed arms and backs. They danced lovely canons. Sometimes the spacing may have felt just a tiny, little, itty bitty titch off, but it also could have been the angle of my seat. Unfortunately, Michael Gianfrencesco's beautiful costumes were just a little to long to get a good view of the ladies feet, although they're necessary for the period of the design. You win some, you lose some and speaking of winning some. The men of the ballet (#salutlesboys) are riveting. The partner work was on point (not _en pointe_ - to be clear), beautiful footwork, and masculine graceful lines. It was exciting to see. Again, I mention the final Tamburino because the boys knock it out of the park.\n\n### To see or not to see?\n\n**Jenna**: _Alcina_ \nfeatures some incredible singing by some of Canada's best, and you'll be treated to eye-candy of all sorts throughout the evening. I'm a Handel fan, and this production is a place to see it full of honed skills and lots of imagination. Would recommend, despite any personal quibbles.\n\n**Greg**: Overall I really enjoyed it. It's Handel, so it takes a bit of a brain adjustment musically and historically, but when you're ready and this show takes off it's wonderful. Opera Atelier is trying new things which is really exciting, whilst not compromising any of the aesthetic and expertise in a niche Toronto desperately deserves. Keep going, OA, you're TOTALLY on the right track and I'm #stokedissimo about it.\n\n<div class=\"intro\">_Alcina_ plays at the Elgin Theatre until November 1st.

        "body": "I was in rehearsal for an upcoming concert, and the only thing left to look at was the encore. I always feel like a lame impostor, rehearsing an encore. The whole idea of the encore is that it's a repetition of a song that the audience clearly loved (\"encore\" is French for \"again\"), or it's a bonus number, understood that it's of the _impromptu_ sort. So here I am, rehearsing my spontaneity, all the while assuming (somewhat narcissistically, I might add) that the audience will love me so much that they will _demand_ more. It's one of those conundrums of Classical music that's hard to defend to the layperson.\n\nThe word \"encore\" comes from the French for \"again\"; but we all knew that, and I did some more digging on the history of the encore. Before the time of recorded music, an encore was the only way someone could hear their favourite song again. It was like putting a song on repeat. If it was a bonus-track-type of encore, it wasn't the crowd-pleaser of the night; it was likely a more obscure piece, perhaps newly written yet uncirculated. When you think about it, it's almost more of a compliment to warrant an encore when the audience has already heard your greatest hits. Today, it's traditional to save something light, funny, famous, or jaw-dropping for the encore, and audiences are in on the plan, too. Maybe today's classical musicians are passive-aggressively securing themselves an encore by withholding the most desirable music all night long.\n\nIn the world of opera, encores are pretty rare. I think it's a really special moment for the singer, but others disagree. Toscanini famously banned encores at La Scala and The Metropolitan Opera for the better part of the 20th century, saying they brought too much focus to individual singers and broke the flow of the opera. The bans are also in place to avoid show times running long and costing the companies in overtime pay. The bans have been broken a few times, mostly by irreverant tenors. Peruvian high-note-machine [Juan Diego Flórez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aS6M8j3pvQ) actually broke _both_ encore bans, 9 high Cs at a time, with \"Ah, mes amis\" from _La fille du regiment_; he encored it at La Scala in [2007](http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2003586868_encore24.html), and at the Met in [2008](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/24/classicalmusicandopera.world). _Plus_,[ he did it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQY19jmxCvI) at the Met in 2012 with \"Una furtiva lagrima\", complete with new high notes for the second cadenza. Earlier this year, Mexican tenor [Javier Camarena](http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/javier-camarena-gives-rare-encore-metropolitan-opera/) also sang an encore of \"Si, ritrovarla\" during the Met's _La Cenerentola_ (fun fact: he was filling in for Juan Diego Flórez). Naturally, [Luciano Pavarotti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8-APBmCQyQ) broke the Met's encore ban too, reprising \"E lucevan le stelle\" during the [1994 _Tosca_](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/arts/opera-review-vaness-and-pavarotti-in-tosca.html) with Carol Vaness.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of records, Pavarotti had the most curtain calls ever recorded: 165, after a 1988 performance of _L'elisir d'amore_ at the Deutsche Oper Berlin. Apparently the applause lasted 1hr, 7 minutes, less than his personal record of 1hr, 30 minutes. Plácido Domingo, not to be forgotten, enjoyed a 1hr, 20 minute applause after a 1991 _Otello_ at the Wiener Staatsoper, with 101 curtain calls in total (there's a bit of [discrepancy](http://www.mervinblock.com/?q=node/34) over the details of this record, but they still average out to _impressive_). What is _with_ these tenors?\n\nPerhaps Toscanini was right, that encores miss the point of the opera as a whole experience, that it's tacky for one singer to steal the night. But take, for example, a performance like [Rolando Villazón's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8_AfrqbT5k) as Nemorino in the Weiner Staatsoper's _L'elisir d'amore_ in 2005\\. He sings \"Una furtiva lagrima\" (again with the Donizetti-tenor combo-pack!) and brings down the house, finally singing it, beautifully, again. And, I mean, look at [these eyes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8_AfrqbT5k&t=5m4s). If Rolando's face doesn't tell you what a special experience an encore is for a singer today, I refer you to [these eyes ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8_AfrqbT5k&t=5m37s)instead. Oh, just watch the whole thing:\n\nMy point is this: encores are anti-dramatic, and they miss the big operatic picture. But, you know, if a singer has worked their tush off to sound the way they do, and the audience reacts in proportion to that mountain of work, I'd say a bow is in order. Singers get instructed up to their eyeballs their whole life long. If they get the chance to have That Moment they're all striving for, sit back and let them have it.",

        "body": "I'm spending this month touring around Ontario, [putting on opera for kids](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/Schools/SchoolTour.aspx?agilitychannel=website). We bring a whole set, costumes, props and electric keyboard, to school gyms and perform for hundreds of kids, twice a day. It's a lot of early mornings, a lot of equipment-schlepping, and a lot of time in the tour van. But it's worth it. From where I sit at the piano, I can look out at the sea of kids as they take in live opera, probably for the first time in their lives. There's the usual gamut of reactions, like wide-eyed awe, laughter, terror, and indifference. I love them all, even the blatant hands covering ears when the singers get a bit too close for comfort.\n\nIt's true that enough slapstick comedy will get laughs from kids, even without much artistry behind it. But children are an honest litmus test for something like opera. They react in a big way, using their voices and bodies to tell the performers just how they feel about what's happening onstage. Conversely, it's really noticeable when there's no reaction at all. If a performer mumbles his words, a joke falls flat and crickets are heard. If there's no eye contact, no connection between singers and the kids, it's pretty easy to lose their attention and never get it back. Stage director [Ashlie Corcoran](http://www.ashliecorcoran.com/) has her fair share of experience in directing children's opera: \"When I am directing an opera for children, my number one priority is that they have an artistic and cultural experience. By that, I mean that sometimes live performance directed at children is used as a vehicle to explore an issue, or a moral or a lesson. Personally, my priority is that the young audience walks away from their experience jazzed by what they saw - curious about the music, about staging and design, and inspired by live storytelling. Basically - wanting to see more opera, or theatre, or dance.\"\n\nPerforming for kids never fails to remind me of the \"why?\" in all this opera that we do. It jolts me out of the mainstream opera scene, and I can take an objective survey of the point of it all. See, the thing with kids is they don't have much patience for self-indulgent entertainment. There exists a fair amount of self-indulgence in \"adult\" opera (I say a \"fair\" amount in the sense that it's not always bad to be selfish in an opera. For singers, sometimes it's just necessary), and adult audiences are much more likely to forgive it. If a singer is singing a note-perfect, blandly-acted Violetta, opera-going grown-ups are more prone to enjoy the show and ignore the lack of storytelling. But singing for its own sake won't travel far with kids.\n\nIt's all about the story, and that holds the creators of opera for young people to a high standard of artistic integrity. I asked [Dean Burry](http://www.deanburry.com/), Canadian composer of several children's operas (_The Brothers Grimm_, _The Bremen Town Musicians_, _The Scorpion's Sting: An Egyptian Myth_), about his process: \"Young people are generally not as jaded towards contemporary music as adults are, so, amazingly, they are often more open to new sounds. If the music is clear and engaging, they will usually go the distance for you. Yes, when writing for young people you need an exciting story, clarity of text and musical idea, and something which is relevant...but isn't that what everyone wants? I think a lot of so called 'grown-up' works could learn a lot from a 'children's' aesthetic.\"\n\nThat last sentence of Dean's is an important one; understanding that audiences of all ages demand the same thing can be a lightbulb moment for creators of opera. One of the things in common between audiences of all ages is that no homework is necessary to be moved by live theatre and music. It's a fair assumption that most kids under ten years old haven't seen opera, and perhaps they haven't seen any form of live theatre at all. With that in mind, it's really an amazing thing to see hundreds of kids simply react to what they see and hear. My biased opinion is that these kids are _totally loving_ opera. \"Writing for 4 to 12 year olds in itself is a big challenge,\" says Dean. \"This is where it is so important to create a multi-layered work. The younger kids love the slapstick (so do I) and the older ones can appreciate the more sophisticated story elements and metaphors. Honestly, I never write with one specific group in mind. I think it is possible for a good work of art to have something for everyone...and most of the times, parents and teachers seem to enjoy my operas as much as the kids. That means a lot to me.\"\n\nFrankly, when it comes to kids getting introduced to opera, it doesn't matter what they noticed or liked; it doesn't even matter if they remember the show. The point is for them to have seen and heard something new, and for them to _feel something_. Says Ashlie, \"One of the most fun parts of directing opera for children is the power that can be found in breaking the fourth wall. I encourage the singers I am working with to make real eye contact with the children sitting at their feet - to use them as their confidents and advocates. It's the best way to hold children's attention - and involve them in the story!\" If kids experience a connection to live theatre, even one time, perhaps the idea of opera won't be associated with vague ideas of boredom and inaccessibility when they become adults. And when those adults start deciding how they want to spend their disposable income, perhaps tickets to a live show will be on the list.",

It's narrated by [Nelson Eddy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Eddy), and he's also the sole voice behind all the singing (including a wicked falsetto for the ladies).

The music selected played to the strengths of all involved and they shared with us some beautiful art.\n\nCesaroni's dark lyric soprano sailed through the unconventional room with ease. Her top range as thrilling as ever and her charisma was palpable. Every entrance demands your attention and her skill at relating to an audience in an intimate setting is something to admire. For some singers the divide from the audience is a large part of their artistic development, not so with Lucia. I felt at times I was in her living room or having a 90s style sleepover complete with that board game where you call potential boyfriends.\n\nIt was really nice to hear Adrian sing some full long lines. I saw him last tearing it up for[ Opera 5](http://www.operafive.com/) in the Hahn/Offenbach double-bill which was difficult for different reasons. Here we get more of his lyrical line and hearing his tone opening up over the top is exciting. One piece that stood out for me was \"Mamma\". Kramer channelled an Italian balladeer and I felt like I may have been at a trattoria witnessing an enamoured, handsome man breaking out into song to \"peacock\" for his beloved.\n\nThe choreography by Jennifer Nichols was superbly danced by her and Justin De Bernardi. A lyric contemporary styling that blooms from a naturalistic, contemporary posture. An exploration of the human physique that played with physical contact, proximity, and fluctuations between smooth lines and sharp angles.\n\nMaka'i Nash, as always, is a top drawer orchestra who actually made me like Schumann piano for a change.\n\nI did get the feeling that this is a work in progress at times - a work I'm excited to see develop. There were some great moments of incorporating the dancers and singers. I'd like to see that developed as a more thorough concept. That being said, this is exactly the kind of event Toronto needs a tonne more of. A lovely evening of entertainment with beautiful people doing beautiful things.\n\nIf this shows up in another incarnation I strongly urge all of Toronto to go. You will not be disappointed.",

        "body": "This is a joint review with contributor Greg Finney. [Read more by Greg](http://schmopera.com/author/greg/).\n\n**Jenna**: On Saturday night I went with go-to concert date [Greg Finney](/author/greg/) to Trinity St. Paul's Centre on Bloor Street to hear the great [Aprile Millo](http://www.aprilemillo.org/) in recital. Upon opening sitting down and flipping through the programme, I was a little humbled to find out that I really should have known more about Aprile. She had a collection of photos from her impressive career, including shots of her at the Met with Pavarotti, Domingo, or hanging out with Marilyn Horne, Michael Jackson, and _her friend Elizabeth Taylor_. In 1984, Aprile had a dramatic debut at the Met when she filled in for an ill soprano to sing Amelia in _Simon Boccanegra _with James Levine. The reviews were rave, and she became a staple at the Met. Serious credentials indeed. In this second of two recitals she gave here in Toronto, Aprile was joined by pianist [Linda Ippolito](http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/4361454-york-s-linda-ippolito-intertwines-music-and-law/), mezzo-soprano (and accordionist!) [Mary-Lou Vetere](http://legacy.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=12802&f_id=29), baritone [Gustavo Ahualli](http://www.gustavoahualli.com/), tenor Giacomo Folinazzo, and harpist [Merynda Adams](http://www.merynda.com/).\n\n**Greg**: So, yeah. I done got schooled in Opera on Saturday night, yo! HOLY CRAP!! Jenna and I bounced over to Trinity St. Paul's to hear Aprile Millo in \"The Toronto Recital\". Not gonna lie, I felt like I did her a great injustice by not being terribly cognisent of her career to date. I apologize, Ms. Millo, from the depths of my heart. Flipping through the programme to see what repertoire I was in for we found a collection of photos with Millo with Pavarotti, Domingo, Tebaldi, Horne, Elizabeth Taylor, and Michael Jackson (THE WOMAN IS IN THE SAME PHOTO AS MJ!!! #internalscreams). Needless to say, as the house lights went down, my excitement went way, WAY, up.\n\n**Jenna**: The evening with Aprile Millo was exactly what you'd expect from someone who's sung with everyone, in every major opera house: it was a night with a true professional. She was delightful to watch, cracking jokes with an endearing air of honesty. When her voice first rang through the amazing acoustic of Trinity St. Paul's, it was like hearing a real culmination of Aprile's full life as a singer. The 56-year-old soprano showed off a voice that had been meticulously maintained; she had a warm, raw sound that was always spinning through _really satisfying legato_. When she rose into her top range, it was that really thrilling thing where smart singing gets you the best result; she nearly tore the roof off above the staff, and I loved it so much.\n\n**Greg**: She took the stage with Linda Ippolito (who was phenomenal all night!!!) at the piano for the first half and from the very first note she sang, I knew I was in the presence of what I like to call \"The Real Effing Deal\". Full sound, flawless technique and OMG the diction! I felt like I was chewing through every consonant along with her, and for a concert laden with foreign language works (to anglophones) the lack of translations was no issue. Her communication was so clear and focused; I had no trouble following the narrative of some of the pieces with which I was less familiar (here's looking at you, Rachmaninoff, and believe you me - for a guy from Cape Breton Island to understand a story in operatic Russian is a big deal).\n\n**Jenna**: Aprile really does come from that school of singers who simply feed us sound, relentlessly. She sang every single letter with what felt like endless sound. It reminded me what it meant to be drawn in by a human voice; I couldn't tear my eyes or ears away from her. She sang grand renditions of Strauss Lieder, and one of my favourite Rachmaninoff songs (\"Ne poy krasavitsa\"). In a beautiful change of sonority, Aprile sang a set of English songs with harpist Merynda Adams, including a show-stopping \"Danny Boy\". I loved what the sound of the harp did to the sound of her voice; I wondered if her huge power would drown out a delicate harp, but instead Aprile proved that power wasn't her only tool.\n\n**Greg**: I don't want to talk about technique or selection or anything like that. I'd like to talk about Ms. Millo as a treasure we should be mining. Her breadth of experience (predominantly at, oh, nowhere huge, just the [Metropolitan Opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprile_Millo#Career_highlights)). This woman was a _tour de force_, singing with a quality of voice that hearkens back to a bygone era of glorious soaring voices that sung for the rafters. I felt like I was being transported back to the glory days of the 70s. Her colours, her timbre and her extreme facility throughout her entire vocal range, tell the story of a true, seasoned professional with years of hard-work and top notch technique. I was floored by her Verdi, and her _La fanciulla del West_ did not disappoint.\n\n**Jenna**: She earned applause, shouts, and whistles with all of the Strauss and Rachmaninoff and Frank Bridge, but it was with the Italian rep that Aprile really showed her stuff. She gave us Neapolitan songs twice during the evening starting off with a set of Donaudy, Tosti, Donizetti, and Verdi that brought me plenty of nostalgia. Later in the program, with Mary-Lou Vetere on accordion (perhaps the most glamourous accordion-playing I've ever seen in my life), Aprile sang some songs I didn't know by Arturo Buzzi-Peccia. They were _so fun_. I remember being wowed by how agile Aprile's voice was, racing up to touch the top of her range without forgetting to bring her whole voice with her. I also remember wondering how anyone can play the accordion, let alone with the skill and attitude (and great dress) that Mary-Lou showed. Definitely a highlight of the night.\n\n**Greg**: She had some special guests show up: baritone [Gustavo Ahualli](http://www.gustavoahualli.com/) joined her for the duet \"Ciel, mio padre\" from _Aida_. He kept his own with a full, warm, caramelly baritone with an easy top that was exciting and calming to listen to, and he stood his own with Millo, a powerhouse of the genre. I saw a harpist listed in the program and thought, \"This might be where we get lost\". Not so, neither. Millo showed she's more than just a cannon ready to fire off massive dramatic rep, but also an intelligent and artistic singer who really makes music with compatriots on the stage - and I'm a tough sell on \"Danny Boy\" (Irish heritage, learned it at 6 years old, have to sing it for Mom every time I'm home, grew up with hardworking men singing this song - which is how I believe it should be heard), but I tell you, I was back on the cliff overlooking Sydney Harbour watching the caribou sail off to Newfoundland for about 4 minutes during the piece, and I can't thank Ms. Millo enough for that.\n\n**Jenna**:Aprile brought us back to opera several times during her recital, with \"Laggiù nel soledad\" from Puccini's _La fanciulla del West_, and the _Aida_ duet \"Ciel, mio padre!\" with baritone Gustavo Ahualli. Gustavo had a great Verdi-baritone sound with a menacing top; he held his own against Aprile's cannon of sound, so that's pretty darn impressive. The night closed with the trio from _Norma_, \"O di qual sei tu vittima!\" with Mary-Lou Vetere, tenor Giacomo Folinazzo, and a chorus of the Vetere Studio. Mary-Lou, freshly back from the accordion-playing, sang Adalgisa with a rich, dark sound (in another beautiful gown). Tenor Folinazzo had some moments of wild tuning and edged on shouting, but he sang with surprising power in the _Norma_ trio.\n\n**Greg**: Now let's talk about Mary Lou Vetere and her rockstar accordion. AWESOME!! I love me some accordion all the time - nothing makes a tango better - but this was out of this world. The Neapolitan songs (Yes, \"Funiculi, Funicula\" was sung) were the highlight of the night for me. So nice to hear a unique instrument accompanying the voice for a change. Vetere's playing was the right mix of classical, jazz, rock n' roll and opera. I loved every second of it.\n\n**Jenna**: At the piano, Linda Ippolito filled Trinity St. Paul's Centre with a confident sound, the kind that lets me hear the instrument's real potential. I loved her touch with the Strauss set (what pianist doesn't indulge when they're given Strauss?), and she showed some wicked chops in songs like \"Love Went A' Ridin'\", by Frank Bridge. She was also a great orchestra; there was absolutely no wimping out on the _Aida_ duet and she had a beautiful Puccini-friendly sound for the _Fanciulla_ aria. I kept thinking how fun it must have been for Linda to play for Aprile. The two of them together had a really elastic connection, with room for playing on both sides and lots of intuition. It's the kind of duo work I love to see.\n\n**Greg**: I believe we need to make an effort to celebrate treasures like this in our operatic community. It may be to late for us to hear Pavarotti sing live, but make sure you hear her before she retires - not that it sounds likely anytime soon - you'll be the better for it.\n\n**Jenna**: I always love watching a singer with such rich experience take the stage as if it's their home. When you get a chance to hear something like that, it's like you're seeing something rare, you're privy to some privileged insight into a singer's life. I think I needed this night with Aprile Millo; it was one to be remembered. Trinity-St. Paul's Centre is a hub for concerts, where you can catch [Tafelmusik](http://www.tafelmusik.org/concerts-tickets/subscriptions-2013-14/concerts-trinity-st-pauls-centre), the [Toronto Consort](http://www.torontoconsort.org/season/schedule.html), and [Soundstreams](http://www.soundstreams.ca/performance-tickets/2014/2014-2015-Season/Vesper) events (and more). It's a beautiful space, and I've seen only great artists perform in it.",

        "body": "## Charles Sy, tenor (Toronto)\n\n**1\\. What makes a good competitor?**\n\nQuite frankly, a strong constitution and nerves of steel. Full opera performances are always fun to be a part of because at that point your performances have been well-rehearsed (hopefully...) and you are doing what you love to do. Competitions are along the same track but there is an additional necessity to perform to the best of your ability right then and there. One shot to get it right. Of course, as a singer your whole career is about being judged and compared to others. In a competition, the comparison is just a little more tangible and real. I think the most important thing to remember is that all competitions are a crapshoot and you just can't take anything personally. Take everything constructively and critically and decide whether or not the result is real and should be addressed for future reference or if it is just ONE person's personal opinion that can be thrown away for now. There are just so many variables when it comes to doing well in competitions beyond how your voice sounds on that particular day. Once your mindset switches from \"This has to be the best performance of my life\" to \"This is a representation of who I am right now. Take it or leave it.\" then you start to take a lot of the pressure off of yourself and can just enjoy what it is that you love to do.\n\n**2\\. Do you have a performance day routine? Lucky underwear?**\n\nWhen possible, I like to be in bed by 9:30pm the night before a performance. I always start the day with a nice, big breakfast and then go for a jog to wake up my body before the performance. Unfortunately, I have not found any of my undergarments to be particularly lucky. However, whenever possible, I like to wear a silver chain bracelet and titanium/black onyx ring that I got as gifts from my mother. She is definitely my biggest fan and has been such a huge support during my entire singing career. It is comforting to know that regardless of all of the many variables involved in performing, from sickness to thick vocal folds to extremely dry and acoustically poor performance spaces, that there is something on stage with me that I know is consistent and never changing.\n\n**3\\. What do you anticipate most during the evening?**\n\nThe opportunity to sing on the main stage of The Four Seasons Centre of course! After years and years of being inspired by watching great opera in my hometown, I now have the opportunity to be on that coveted stage. It has been a dream of mine to sing in that hall ever since I first became interested in opera and after all of these years it is finally going to happen. To top it all off, I have the privilege of performing with the renowned COC orchestra led by the incredible Johannes Debus. This is not an opportunity that comes every day and I plan to enjoy every minute of it. One of my favourite parts of being an opera singer is being backstage when the orchestra is tuning. It is a simple pleasure that I never take for granted and reminds me how much I have to be thankful for before every performance.\n\n**4\\. What role does this competition play in your development as a professional singer?**\n\nIn my opinion, every performance is a new opportunity and challenge to grow as a singer and also as a person. This competition is by far one of the biggest challenges I have ever had to face. It is funny that the two arias that were selected for me in the final round happen to be two of the very first arias I ever learned in my formal studies as a classical singer. It has all come back full circle and it is as if I have been preparing for this one performance for the last 6 years of my life. Of course, this competition is not the finish line but rather the next hurdle in my career path. Regardless of the outcome on November 25th, I hope that another six years from now, I can look back to this day and see how much it has taught me in order to deal with the newer opportunities and challenges I will be facing in the future.\n\n**5\\. What will be your goal when you step on the Four Seasons Centre stage?**\n\nThe thing a lot of people don't know about me is that I have (or at least used to have) horrible stage anxiety. Before walking on stage, I always felt like I was going to vomit and felt the need to go to the bathroom. On stage, my legs would shake and my voice would waver. There were many times in my life that I figured that there was no way that this was the right career path for me. As time went on and I got more performing experience, I was able to experiment with different levels of positive self-talk before and during a performance. This year has been one of the most vocally intense years of my life, from being a vocal fellow at Marilyn Horne's [Music Academy of the West](http://www.musicacademy.org/) in Santa Barbara, California, to winning the grand prize at this year's Jeunes Ambassadeurs Lyriques gala performances in Montreal and now a finalist in one of the most important young artist competitions in Canada. After years of performing with debilitating fear, I am now able to remind myself that it is a privilege to be on stage as a singer. I have been given the opportunity to share my love for what I do and to communicate with an audience that is willing to listen. I have no right to be afraid. Win or lose, if I am able to communicate with every audience member in that hall and not be hindered by gripping fear then I will have considered the night a success.\n\n***\n\n## Michelle Siemens, mezzo-soprano (Calgary)\n\n**1\\. What makes a good competitor?**\n\nA good competitor competes with his or her own self. Comparing yourself to the competition is pointless because the only performance you can control is your own. Obviously it’s not the easiest mindset to maintain, but a good competitor will try and keep it in mind. I’ve found that the best way to maintain a positive mindset for any competitive situation is to wish for the best performance possible for everyone involved.\n\n**2\\. Do you have a performance day routine? Lucky underwear?**\n\nOn performance days I like to be sure that I’m well rested and also try to fit in a workout so that I can be physically warmed up and engaged. Backstage, I like to have water with lemons and a couple of granny smith apples with me. A few high energy dance moves are also great for getting pumped up.\n\n**3\\. What do you anticipate most during the evening?**\n\nI am most looking forward to the sight of the Four Seasons Centre from the perspective of the stage. It is a view that I’ve dreamed of seeing from the singers’ side. I just hope that I will be able to soak in the moment as much as possible.\n\n**4\\. What role does this competition play in your development as a professional singer?**\n\nThe competition is a crucial step to bridge the divide between being a student and a professional. After years of being a student it can be hard to recognize when it is the right time to trust that you are ready vocally and artistically to enter the professional realm. This competition and the possibility of entering the COC Ensemble, are ways to support this challenging transition.\n\n**5\\. What will be your goal when you step on the Four Seasons Centre stage?**\n\nMy goal is to breathe, have fun, and take in the moment. I want to experience the joy of the art form in which I have invested all of myself and, as always, to share a meaningful connection with the audience.\n\n***\n\n## Aaron Sheppard, tenor (St. John's)\n\n**1\\. What makes a good competitor?**\n\nI think a good competitor is someone that isn't afraid to make a mistake, or take a chance. I believe this keeps everything interesting and fresh during a performance.\n\n**2\\. Do you have a performance day routine? Lucky underwear?**\n\nI just like doing what I would do on a regular day, maybe sleep-in a little bit if the performance is at night.\n\n**3\\. What do you anticipate most during the evening?**\n\nI am driven by performance, so I can’t wait to get out there and feel the support and atmosphere that the audience creates.\n\n**4\\. What role does this competition play in your development as a professional singer?**\n\nThis competition is a fantastic way to get invaluable performance experience, with an orchestra. I think it's a great stepping stone for all young aspiring singers.\n\n**5\\. What will be your goal when you step on the Four Seasons Centre stage?**\n\nI would love to just be proud of my performance, and have a fun time while doing so.\n\n****\n\n## Zoe Band, mezzo-soprano (Toronto)\n\n**1\\. What makes a good competitor?**\n\nI think being kind and friendly to everyone involved in the competition process ensures happy feelings and a positive experience for all. You can’t control how other competitors treat you, but exuding positive energy always makes me feel my best. At the same time, I try to forget that I’m a competitor and focus instead on my performance. This approach helps me to perform most openly and achieve the kind of result I strive for.\n\n** 2\\. Do you have a performance day routine? Lucky underwear?**\n\nI regard the performance day like any other day. The goal is to sing well everyday and to practice with the same intensity, whether or not I am preparing for a specific concert. Throughout the day, I warm up on three separate occasions, singing a bit more each time. I like to eat a lot of protein. About six months ago I cut gluten from my diet, and try to avoid coffee and dairy. Coffee is tough to eliminate! As a result, my energy level has improved significantly and contributed to the consistency of my singing. Is lucky underwear a thing? Perhaps I should try it out!\n\n**3\\. What do you anticipate most during the evening?**\n\nI love anticipating the reaction the audience will have to what I am able to express. When I sing, my main endeavor is to communicate – to make people experience and feel the meaning of the words and notes I am singing. I love that moment when the audience is absolutely still, caught up in the music, and transported to another world. I look forward to that kind of moment, to that kind of bond with the audience.\n\n**4\\. What role does this competition play in your development as a professional singer?**\n\nThe thrill of having been chosen as a finalist from such a large pool of singers has given me a great shot of confidence. There is nothing like a competition to make you concentrate on your technique and fine-tune the nuances of your repertoire and performance. My intense focus and drive in the weeks leading up to the competition is a constant reminder of my passion for music and all it can communicate. I’m only getting better in these times and the deadline of a competition intensifies that experience.\n\n**5\\. What will be your goal when you step on the Four Seasons Centre stage?**\n\nProbably to get a hug from Ben Heppner! He is an inspiration. Of course, my goal is to be able to immerse the audience in beautiful singing and pull off the performance that I hear in my mind when I rehearse. If the audience goes quiet and believes the words I am singing and the character I am portraying, then I know I will have achieved the goal I continue to work toward every day. For me the goal isn’t only stepping on the stage, but transporting the audience through the music I am able to sing.\n\n****\n\n## Dimitri Katotakis, baritone (Toronto)\n\n**1\\. What makes a good competitor?**\n\nCompetition is a word with such a diverse set of meanings. Someone in an artistic competition has to be first-most aware of why they are making art. They have to have respect for their goal as an artist, which I think is ideally to communicate the meaning and humanity of their piece. A good competitor, much like a good singer in general should be able to roll with the punches, to share their love for music despite changing circumstances. Lastly, they should be able to enjoy the whole process, to share that joy with their colleagues (their fellow ‘competitors’) and their audience. The gray area between nervous and comfortable is where art thrives, and joy magnifies the whole process.\n\n**2\\. Do you have a performance day routine? Lucky underwear?**\n\nOn days that I perform I usually take it pretty easy, save my energy for the big event. That said, I usually like to move around, keep my body fluid. I try to exercise in some way. Another thing that I like to do is listen to a whole album that I enjoy. Some days it’s symphonic music, others art song, some days it’s Queen, Miles Davis or Jeff Buckley. Something that refreshes me and makes me remember the power of music. Other than that, it’s get my clothes all together, have a nice warm up and start getting ready to go!\n\n**3\\. What do you anticipate most during the evening?**\n\nI’m looking forward to the end of my first piece. The combination of feeling ‘done’ with the expectation of being able to get back on stage to do it all over again is such an overwhelming feeling.\n\n**4\\. What role does this competition play in your development as a professional singer?**\n\nThis competition marks my first foray the professional singing world for me so it’s quite exciting. Before this it's been school and summer programs with occasional other concerts. I’m excited to finally get the chance to show some of what I’ve been learning all these years!\n\n**5\\. What will be your goal when you step on the Four Seasons Centre stage?**\n\nRight now my goal for this performance is not to be perfect or show everyone the culmination of myself as an artist, but rather to just have fun. I want to be able to step off of the stage and think to myself “I made music out there”.\n\n***\n\n## Eliza Johnson, soprano (Stratford)\n\n**1\\. What makes a good competitor?**\n\nYou ask as if I am an expert! Aside from all of the obvious vocal and dramatic demands, it’s all about mindset. Maintaining a grounded, calm, and impenetrable relaxed state is ideal in dealing with many unpredictable elements that will arise. A good competitor is focused, self-assured, confident, kind and gracious. A good competitor is always supportive of fellow competitors.\n\n**2\\. Do you have a performance day routine? Lucky underwear?**\n\nI’ve made many lifestyle adjustments as I have progressed in my life as a singer. Since our job can be so physically, emotionally, and mentally demanding, I really strive to maintain balance and health in my daily life, in order to support my singing.\n\nPerformance day is really no different than any other day. Having recently finished a school tour of _The Magic Flute_ (for young audiences) with Opera Lyra, I’ve had an epiphany that I think is worth sharing. As performers, we are faced with many elements that are beyond our control: traffic, weather, sickness, accidents, injury, etc. There is no perfect set of circumstances in the world that will bring about a better or worse performance. It truly is all about focus and commitment.\n\nThat said, when I do have the opportunity to choose the way I prepare, performance days always start with a big breakfast. I find time to exercise, meditate, and definitely listen to some pump-up music on my commute to a venue.\n\n**3\\. What do you anticipate most during the evening?**\n\nThat electric feeling right before I go on stage. I’m also very excited to sing with the COC Orchestra! The Four Seasons Centre is a really magical venue.\n\n**4\\. What role does this competition play in your development as a professional singer?**\n\nWell, it’s hard to say what the future will hold. It has been a real privilege to be chosen as a finalist for this year’s competition. The media attention and exposure is definitely a good thing for my career, regardless of the results, and participating in such an illustrious competition will surely benefit me in the future as I continue to make valuable connections in the industry. If I am chosen to join the Ensemble Studio, well that’s a whole new ballgame!\n\n**5\\. What will be your goal when you step on the Four Seasons Centre stage?**\n\nI plan on being pretty single-minded in my focus. I want to tell a story: to inspire the imagination of the audience and transport them to a different time and place.\n\nI recently received an overwhelming compliment from a patron after a concert. She rushed up to me and joyously told me that my singing made her dream. I want nothing more than to be totally present and available in my body, mind, heart, and especially in my voice, in order to bring these epic operatic characters to life and to inspire the audience to dream along with me!\n\n***\n\n## Nathan Keoughan, bass-baritone (Charlottetown)\n\n**1\\. What makes a good competitor? **\n\nI think any good competition singer needs to be self aware of their strengths with a healthy dose of reality. Confidence is necessary but no one needs to see an ego. Though I tend to look at this is a competition more as a grandiose audition into an incredible company. I’ve never been much of a \"competitive singer\".\n\n**2\\. Do you have a performance day routine? **\n\nI try to keep performance days as regular as possible. It generally starts with coffee and YouTube. If I’m really on my game I'll try to go to the gym. I find it helps with my air. But If I don’t make it to the gym, that’s okay too…\n\n**3\\. What do you anticipate most during the evening? **\n\nWell of course I’m very excited to have the opportunity to perform with the COC orchestra again. But I must say I most look forward to the 30 seconds following my performance. It can hit you like a shock of electricity, and I imagine they feel very similar. You’re heart rate sky rockets, hands and feet go numb. The adrenaline lasts until you walk backstage and remember it’s a competition and you’re about to be publicly rated. But it’s all worth it for that performance rush.\n\n**4\\. What role does this competition play in your development as a professional singer?**\n\nIt’s all about experience, ain’t it? The evening is designed to be a wonderful platform for a few of us lucky singers to have some Toronto spotlight and to try to make some connections while we can. The biggest impact I’ve had from this competition in the past was the opportunity to sing in that incredible hall without amplification.\n\n**5\\. What will be your goal when you step on the Four Seasons Stage?**\n\nBreathe.\n\n***",

        "body": "Opera doesn't make money,&nbsp;it never has, and we all know it.&nbsp;I was recently asked about opera's economy&nbsp;and why opera companies have never functioned as a for-profit theatre company. The theoretical comparison was between the<a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/Home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> Canadian Opera Company</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mirvish.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mirvish Productions</a>. My initial response to the question of a business model was that there was simply not enough money. Opera is expensive to put up, and expensive to maintain; Mirvish Productions was funded with Ed Mirvish's wealth, and designed to make money from its theatres and productions.&nbsp;As with most opera and theatre companies worldwide, the COC receives government grants, and both corporate and individual donations to supplement their revenue from ticket sales. Without that <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/SupportTheCOC/CorporateSupport/OurCorporatePartners.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">kind of support</a>, the math simply wouldn't add up. We know this in the theatre industry; it's nothing new. So, with all the generous donors keeping opera afloat, why&nbsp;hasn't there been a notable attempt to invest in starting an opera company that will eventually self-sustain?</p><p>For an opera house&nbsp;to operate as a for-profit company, it can't rely on government grants or donations (only non-profit organizations can do that); its revenue needs to come from ticket sales. That's a huge shift from the current state of opera economics. For most companies, cutting grants and donations would wipe out around <a href=\"http://files.coc.ca/pdfs/1314_COCAnnualReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">half of their revenue</a>. They would have to rely on ticket sales, which currently make up about 25-40% of most companies' incomes. So, production costs would need to go way down (it was the number one expense, by far, for the <a href=\"http://files.coc.ca/pdfs/1314_COCAnnualReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">COC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vancouveropera.ca/sites/default/files/2014-VOA-Financials.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Vancouver Opera</a>, <a href=\"http://edmontonopera.com/pdf/season/2014/EO_financialstatements.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Edmonton Opera</a>, and <a href=\"http://operalyra.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Audited-Financial-Statements-2012-13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Opera Lyra</a>), and the Canadian Actor's Equity Association would have to do an overhaul on the fee system. Performers under <a href=\"http://caea.com/EquityWeb/EquityLibrary/Agreements/Opera/IOPA/IOPASearchable.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CAEA's Opera agreement</a> earn a weekly fee that's up to twice as much as performers under the <a href=\"http://caea.com/Equityweb/EquityLibrary/Agreements/Theatre/CTA/2012-2015CTAFeeBooklet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Theatre agreement</a>. I'm not saying opera companies pay their artists too much, let me be clear about that. But the fee structure isn't sustainable for a business model that depends on a 40-50 show run, as opposed to a standard opera run of 4-10 shows.</p><p>As I hunted for examples of for-profit theatre companies, I stumbled across <a href=\"http://www.gorillatango.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gorilla Tango Theatre</a>, a Chicago-based, for-profit theatre distribution and promotion&nbsp;company. <a href=\"http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/artist-stories/making-theater-makes-money\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Abbate</a> founded the company&nbsp;in 2006, in a different fashion than your everyday startup theatre company.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gorillatango.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gorilla Tango Theatre</a>&nbsp;provides all the large, upfront expenses for production, like performance and rehearsal space, lighting, sound, box office services, house management, etc. Shows being produced through GTT must make a minimum box office revenue of&nbsp;$250 per hour of performance; after the minimum has been met, GTT and the theatre company split profits 50/50. after which they split profits 50/50 with the theatre companies. The goal is to expand to various performance venues&nbsp;throughout the US (and hopefully Canada) in order to house more productions in more cities.&nbsp;\"Our success is a direct function of our business model being based on profitability and sustainability, rather than a specific creative agenda. This enables GTT to be nimble and adjust our product mix based on market demand. We are not tied to a specific mission (which can be difficult to change in a nonprofit even when that mission is no longer working for the organization), nor is our ability to make quick decisions restrained by the group politics often found on non-profit boards.\"</p><p>Abbate isn't an artist first; he's a businessman first. I think the idea of starting a theatre company without first having a love for art is distasteful for many working artists. But shout it be? \"Theater&nbsp;academics and authorities are stuck in tradition and 'the way things have always been done.' They are generally disconnected from the world around them, which is constantly changing and moving forward,\" Dan says. \"The people who don't succeed in theater probably couldn't run any other sort of business either. I think that is the root of the problem. People who are interested in the creative side of theater should focus on being creative. They should not be starting companies.\" Business savviness though he may have, there's one big catch with Abbate's plan: Gorilla Tango Theatre won't distribute shows&nbsp;for Equity companies. \"The projects they produce often don’t appeal to a broad market (Joe and Jill Everyperson are generally not terribly interested in traditional works) and their cost structures do not lend themselves to likely profit. I have seen many proposals for shows where the company would not make a profit even if every show were sold out.\"</p><p>Here in Toronto,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.soulpepper.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Soulpepper Theatre Company</a>&nbsp;has also&nbsp;found a way around the standard, inflexible, method of programming a season. Says <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/theatre-and-performance/torontos-soulpepper-theatre-embraces-new-business-model/article564918/\" target=\"_blank\">J. Kelly Nestruck</a> at <em>The Globe and Mail</em>,&nbsp;\"Plays are programmed for a set number of weeks - and whether they're hits or they're flops, they have about the same number of performances. There's very little relationship between supply and demand.\" It seems like an obvious oversight; Soulpepper artistic director Albert Schultz recognized that \"no other business in the world operates this way and it just makes no sense.\" Soulpepper has begun scheduling shows and engaging artists in short-term increments of a few months, employing&nbsp;performers for multi-show contracts. This method leaves them free to adjust the remainder of their season according to the popularity of each show.</p><p>It seems so simple: listen to the demand, and give the audience what it wants. Why don't opera companies operate like this? Because their programming and casting have become inflexible. Productions and artists are booked multiple seasons in advance, and mid-season changes&nbsp;are almost impossible without losing cast members (particularly the biggest names). Again, the CAEA agreement and other unions would have to completely revamp their stipulations to accommodate shorter-term booking and mid-season changes according to audience demand. And since we're talking about a for-profit opera company, the creative decisions for the season would no longer be tied to receiving grant money and donations. It really could be about what the audience wants to see more and less onstage. &nbsp;What would that look like?&nbsp;Would it be nothing but&nbsp;<em>La bohème</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>? Or would a \"working on commission\" mindset push creative teams to prove opera's relevance and deliver live theatre that fills the house the same way Mirvish's&nbsp;<em>Les misérables&nbsp;</em>can?</p><p>I think this brings us to the crux of the opera business model (really, any business model): if the product isn't in demand, you won't make money. I hate to think that the reason&nbsp;an opera company couldn't go for-profit is that not enough people will ever go. Since I'm sure I'm nowhere near the first person to ask these questions about opera's monetary potential, perhaps artsy economists have already figured out that non-profit status is the only way most opera and theatre can survive. If we grant that not enough bums are in seats at the opera, would cutting production costs, extending show runs, and actually listening to the audience demand be enough to change that? Is there an arts-loving investor willing to put down <em>lots of money</em> to see how long it takes to make any of it back? These questions are making me sound more and more naïve, aren't they?</p>",

My singer friend didn't find it fascinating, perhaps due to the sympathy he couldn't help but feel for the voices. Perhaps singers will find me somewhat odd for this, but I think Perle Nere, the three-part collection of onstage misses by opera singers, was one of the first ways I became excited about the capabilities and limitations of the human voice. The collection pieces together moments like the _Rigoletto_ quartet with the tenor singing a semitone flat, crazy tenor cracks in _Aida_, missed high notes in _Flute_, onstage drunkenness, etc. It's [AfroPoli](https://www.youtube.com/user/AfroPoli/featured)'s YouTube channel, and his commentary gives context to the clips, as snarky as it sometimes may be. So, a disclaimer for the readers who sing: this may gain a reaction similar to when a guy watches another guy get hit below the belt. But I think it's neat to hear vocal \"mishaps\", because you can start to hear how the thing should be put together. Anyway, enjoy?\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5k6c4MBG7h8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n>/figure>\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6hZweYnWdAk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1blyLl4tiQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>",

        "body": "If you love opera, you probably love Mozart's _Don Giovanni_. The jury is out, however, on the question of whether or not you like Donna Anna. \"Hmm, tough one,\" say you. Mozart and Da Ponte start this story of Don Juan just after his encounter with Donna Anna, which means we can only infer information from the last pieces of their post-coital conversation. Anna is angry with Giovanni because he doesn't want to stick around, but she runs off when she hears her father coming. When Anna sees Giovanni again, she's with her boyfriend, Ottavio, and they both have already found her father dead. Anna silently puts it together that her one-night-stand was her dad's killer, and when she goes to tell Ottavio, she realizes she also has to tell him how she knows Giovanni in the first place. Hence, all the juicy musical dishonesty in Mozart's writing for Donna Anna. I skip ahead in the opera to bring you my examples.\n\n##Exhibit A:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428978831649/NonMiDir1-1024x682.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nIt's a bit from Donna Anna's second aria, \"Non mi dir\". She's talking to Don Ottavio, who's trying to politely bring up the topic of marriage (what a jerk), and Anna avoids giving him an answer by making him feel terrible for bothering her at all. Saying things like, \"Don't call me mean, you know I love you, please calm down or you'll make me so sad I'll die\" (I paraphrase Da Ponte). This moment of genius by Mozart is what I like to call The World's Most Beautiful Whine. Just look at Anna's line, starting unnaturally high in her voice, and proceeding to smear up and down like a siren. Look at those last two notes on the word \"dir\". They're lies! Look at how shocked and appalled Anna is during those snappy chords under \"i-o\" (she's in the middle of saying, \"Don't tell me that I've been cruel with you.\"). She's more likely saying, \"Don't tell me _**I've**_ been cruel with you.\" What a hussy. And then she gets into all this nonsense:\n\n##Exhibit B:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428978874157/NonMiDir3-1024x682.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nShe's now past directly making Ottavio feel terrible; now she's doing it by saying \"Well, maybe at least heaven will have pity on me.\" The blurry notes at the top of the page are incessant runs (that are wickedly impressive) on the words \"will feel\", so Mozart is clearly driving that point home. But at the bottom of the page, that big fat \"pietà di _**me**_\" (\"pity on me\"), that's the real kicker. It's overkill. It doesn't need to be that high. But people who aren't telling truths speak with weird inflection. Like a random, additional high A on the word \"me\" (either language works). See, I think that Mozart created Anna as a character who wants to maintain privacy over a few details of her encounter with Don Giovanni. I'm not saying she was into it and then went screaming assault, but I do think there's some musical equivalence to the saying, \"the lady doth protest too much, methinks.\"\n\nI just freaking love Mozart. Says the beloved and wise Canadian director [Tom Diamond](https://tapestryopera.com/tom-diamond), \"Mozart is the greatest stage director who ever lived.\" Here's Carol Vaness singing the whole aria in 1990:",

        "body": "Without fail, in almost tedious constancy, watching *La bohème* brings out all the feels. Before an upcoming production, I'm more objective, and I can inwardly roll my eyes at the thought of getting swept away by a piece like *La bohème*. It's so obvious, I tell myself, You're falling for low-bar emotional jabs like doomed lovers and friendship despite hardship. But then, you know, I go and see it, and there I am, swept away once again. *La bohème* is a piece that keeps giving as you get to know it better. The tragedy can be found beyond the clear moments created by Puccini, Illica and Giacosa. There exists tragedy too&nbsp;in the small details about the relationship between the Bohemians themselves. For example:\n\n##Exhibit A:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428972552959/BuonaSera-1024x682.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nThis is early in that famous scene where Mimì and Rodolfo meet for the first time. She knocked on his door with a spent candle, asking for help re-lighting it. Rodolfo offers Mimì his candle, there are sparks between them, and she controls herself enough to say, \"goodnight\". The above is his echoing reply. Look at that line of music, at just how; *Italian* it is. Mimì was polite with her \"goodnight\", using the proper inflection and keeping the conversation friendly and neutral; musically, the scene could end right there. Instead, Rodolfo's \"goodnight\" comes dense with meaning. The staccato chords floating around this moment in the scene are the raise of an eyebrow, Rodolfo's amusement and interest in his pretty neighbour. Right when he voices his reply, Puccini slows everything down, and adds a sweeping slur over the words. The pitches themselves, the falling seventh, are hopelessly incomplete; the musical phrase is begging to be continued, kind of like Rodolfo's conversation with Mimì. Rodolfo's subtext is, roughly, \"Yeah, you go ahead and pretend you want to leave. I know you'll be back.\" *So Italian* \n\n##Exhibit B:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428972658391/Seiilmioamor-1024x682.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nFast-forward a few acts, and Mimì is dying from her illness; she comes back to Rodolfo's apartment to say goodbye. After the flurry of making Mimì comfortable, their friends leave them alone,  and those awful brass chords start. You can see them, blurred, at the top of this photo, beating away at my heart. The whole scene is incredible, and the bottom line of this photo is usually the first moment I start to weep against all reason. Mimì sings this bit to Rodolfo, saying, \"You are my love, and my whole life!\" What a thing to say to anyone, at any time, let alone at the end of one's life. Puccini gets it, too; as Mimì sings this touching line, the strings and the voice soar out of the tragic chords, and give us unashamed satisfaction. The harmonies are simple and consonant, the vocal writing puts the soprano in a sweet spot, and it's like artistic alchemy. It's as if Mimì throws away any inhibitions in order to tell Rodolfo how she feels before she dies; no protecting her feelings, no coy games, just her heart.\n\n##Exhibit C:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428972796463/tramonto-1024x682.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nJust one page after the above moment of sad catharsis is this final gem. If you weren't moved by&nbsp; those chords or Puccini's guilty-pleasure melodies, maybe Illica and Giacosa can try their hand. Mimì breaks the tension by asking Rodolfo, \"Am I still pretty?\" He replies, \"Beautiful like a sunrise.\" And then, she makes a joking dig at Rodolfo, a little play on words with the poet: \"You made the wrong comparison. You should have said, 'beautiful like a sunset'.\" *I know!* Every time I translate it, I can see that it's cheesy. But Puccini seals the deal with the music underneath all of this; he brings back all the musical themes from Mimì and Rodolfo's first meeting, to add nostalgia to the pot of emotions. Right after the line about the sunset, Mimì sings a bar of her familiar theme, \"Mi chiamano Mimì\" with plenty of new meaning. At this moment in the score, Puccini has kept the death-tolling brass chords going underneath the musical references to Act I. When the melodies bring back happy memories, but the accompanying chords mean impending tragedy, you've got an audience moved.\n\nWatch my favourite version of *La bohème*, with Kleiber, Pavarotti and Cotrubas at La Scala in 1979:\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kHAS7r8Pd0k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>",

        "body": "I came across two separate articles the other day, on the topic of artists working without pay. The first was [this open letter to Oprah](http://revolva.net/2014/11/13/an-open-letter-to-oprah/), written by Revolva, a professional [hula hoop act ](http://youtu.be/Zhg_9-Pl5k8)and vaudeville performer. Apparently, Oprah's [_The Life You Want Weekend_](http://www.oprahweekend.com/events) tour invited Revolva to work for their San Jose stop earlier this month. The catch: she'd be working for free. Now, I love me a good open letter from an artist standing up for his or her own professional respect (she didn't take the gig), and this instance seemed to me a gross imbalance of value between employer and artist. She writes, \"Events that are netting a metric butt-ton of money are just being unethical to offer artists nothing—or free tickets—or a child’s birthday party rates. And if that’s what’s happening, maybe someone should speak up and say, 'Is this tour about how to achieve to your ‘ideal life’ REALLY going to rattle its tin cup and ask local artists for a free act?'\" Revolva doesn't post her booking rates on her website, but I can't imagine that it would put too much of a dent in the budget for an event like _The Life You Want Weekend_. I mean, it's Oprah, of all things, including speakers like Deepak Chopra. Tickets run from $99-$999\\. I assume there's some money being made. Just not by Revolva.\n\nA few hours later I came across [this story on Slipped Disc](http://slippedisc.com/2014/11/opera-house-goes-looking-for-unpaid-performers/), about Opera Australia's call for students to join the cast of their outdoor production of _Aida_, as unpaid supernumeraries. [Norman Lebrecht](http://slippedisc.com/2014/11/opera-house-goes-looking-for-unpaid-performers/) disapproves of OA's casting call, saying, \"An opera house that employs performers on amateur terms is an amateur opera house.\" My initial instinct is that it's simply different to ask students to perform without pay than it is to ask the same of professionals. Any working artist will understand that even as volunteers, the student supernumeraries that join this professional production of _Aida_ will gain rare and valuable experience (or at the very least, have fun). But it's also a fair assumption that the student is currently studying, and not actively pursuing work in their desired field. Working for free in this case is significantly less of an artistic jab for these students, instead of having their profession undermined by unashamed requests for _pro bono_ work.\n\nIn the case of Opera Australia, one of the growing number of opera houses with financial struggles, it's clear that the decision to call out for unpaid supers is a way to save money. Fair enough. It's not the place to slippery-slope my way into the value of singers, because that's not what this specific decision was about. But when it comes to organizations that are designed to make money and succeed at doing it, it's pretty gross to see how carelessly they approach entertainers for favours. Remember when [Lena Dunham](http://time.com/3446154/anger-abounds-over-lena-dunhams-book-tour-acts-not-getting-paid/) made a \"fun\" contest out of getting free labour for her book tour opening acts? It's just tacky, especially when everyone knows you're rich. Revolva ends her letter by giving Oprah the benefit of the doubt about her _The Life You Want Weekend_ event: \"If you didn’t realize your tour, with its wealthy speakers and its $99 to $999 tickets, was asking for a free service from local acts, is there something you can you do to make it right? On behalf of the artists of the world, that’s a question I’ll leave you with, Oprah. I’d like to believe that, as compassionate and generous as you appear to be, as a self-made woman who has been here, the life YOU want involves people being able to pay their rent.\"\n\nFor more on the topic, follow [@forexposure_txt](https://twitter.com/forexposure_txt) for real quotes from people asking artists to work for experience/exposure/love/definitely no money.",

        "body": "Last night the seven finalists of the COC's Ensemble Studio Competition sang on the stage of the Four Seasons Centre for the second annual <a href=\"http://coccentrestage.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre Stage Gala</a>. I like this event, and I like the hype it brings to this exciting part of today's opera world. This year, Centre Stage was hosted by Canada's favourite tenor, <a href=\"http://www.benheppner.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Heppner</a>, who was as warm and funny as he was respectful of the competitors. The seven singers, dressed in tuxedos and gowns from the Hudson's Bay Company (bonus prize indeed!), each sang two arias with the COC Orchestra under the baton of Music Director <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/Orchestra/JohannesDebus.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Johannes Debus</a>. The orchestra began the night with the overture from Nicolai's&nbsp;<em>Die Lustigen Weiber von Windsor</em>, and reminded the audience just how well they play together. Also, I'm partial to the Nicolai&nbsp;<em>Merry Wives</em> over the more common Lehar, so I was excited to hear it. Four prizes are awarded: first ($5000), second ($3000), and third place ($1500) by the judging panel, as well as an Audience Choice award ($1500). The cash is always nice, but the real prize for this competition is an invitation to join the coveted COC Ensemble Studio Young Artist Program.<p></p><p>Three singers took the four prizes on Tuesday night. Tenor <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/exploreandlearn/newtoopera/onlinelearningcentre/parlandothecocblog.aspx?EntryID=46712\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Sheppard</a> (St. John's, NL) won&nbsp;third prize, baritone <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=46737\" target=\"_blank\">Dimitri Katotakis</a> (Toronto) won second, and tenor <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=46757\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Sy</a> took home both first prize and the Audience Choice award. I had my own personal top three in my head as the judges deliberated, and I'm historically terrible at predicting competition winners. Centre Stage isn't simply about how these singers&nbsp;give an isolated performance; this is the final of several rounds of North American auditions, as well as an intensive week of work with the COC artistic staff. The judges know these finalists well by the time they hear them at the competition, and the results may reflect that (further skewing my already bad competition-radar).</p><p>I thought Charles Sy truly gave the night's best performance. He was vocally and dramatically mature, with a delicious dark tenor sound that stretched easily into shining high notes. He sang \"Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schön\" (<em>Die Zauberflöte</em>), and \"Una furtiva lagrima\" (<em>L'elisir d'amore</em>), and he delivered both like a well-wrapped present with a bow on top. Technically, Charles nailed the notably tricky spots in both arias, like the last page of the Mozart (terrifying and ceaselessly in the&nbsp;<em>passaggio</em>), or the very first entrance of the Donizetti (that [u] vowel on an F, tricky stuff). He deserves accolades for being a smart singer, but he also gave the first real moments of storytelling. He didn't let any physicality distract us from his seriously gorgeous sound, but he filled all the silences, bridged all the dramatic beats, and gave us a&nbsp;<em>person</em> instead of an aria. Well done, Mr. Sy, and congratulations.</p><p><span data-sc-tag=\"[caption id=&quot;attachment_2231&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;456&quot;][/caption]\" class=\"sc-node sc-node-caption\"></span></p><p>Baritone Dimitri Katotakis sang the Count's Aria (<em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>),&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;\"Mab, la reine des mensonges\" (<em>Roméo et Juliette</em>), and proved himself surprisingly chameleon-like. I thought he paced the Mozart in a smart way, not falling into the dramatic traps of playing a blustery, vengeful character. He kept his cool the whole time, giving a more mature telling of the Count's story. It's essentially an aria about revenge, however, and I missed a bit of the fire and brimstone that exists in Mozart's writing. I&nbsp;wondered if Dimitri's choice to focus on solid singing robbed us of some of the dramatic possibilities. In the Gounod, Dimitri embodied a totally different character,&nbsp;and almost sang with a new voice. He was wisely light and agile and was comfy with the endless French. At times&nbsp;he drifted from light singing into crooning, but Dimitri's&nbsp;voice carried well and his was the easiest, most in-control performance of this tricky aria that I've heard.</p><p>Tenor Aaron Sheppard sang two more beloved tenor arias; he started with Lalo's \"Vainement, ma bien aimée\" (<em>Le roi d'Ys</em>), followed by \"Un'aura amorosa\"&nbsp;(<em>Così fan tutte</em>). I thought he had a nice masculine sound, and he reminded me of Jerry Hadley. He tended to hold his sound a bit, and we missed some legato and there were moments of intonation problems.&nbsp;He has what I think will become a really heroic top, and he still gave us two beautiful high As in the Lalo. Out of the men, however, I was most looking forward to hearing bass-baritone <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=46731\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Keoughan</a>. He's a returning competitor, and I've been able to follow his development a little bit over the last couple of years. He started with \"La calunnia è un venticello\" (<em>Il barbiere di Siviglia</em>), and finished with \"Se vuol ballare\" (<em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>). I really love Nathan's voice, and I love that he's made some huge technical advancements. His top is slimmer and he approached those blasted high Fs in the Mozart with a gentler attack; it made them reliable and melodic, rather than the whole crux of the aria. Nathan has this really thrilling, throaty, virile sound that he now carries from bottom to top. He was in my pick for the top three, no question.</p><p><span data-sc-tag=\"[caption id=&quot;attachment_2232&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;456&quot;][/caption]\" class=\"sc-node sc-node-caption\"></span></p><p>Onto the ladies, who were, for the first time in my own competition history, the minority amongst the finalists. Mezzo-soprano <a href=\"http://m.coc.ca/Parlando.aspx?EntryID=46713\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Siemens</a> was the first competitor to sing, giving us&nbsp;Donizetti's \"All'afflitto è dolce il pianto\" (<em>Roberto Devereux</em>) and \"Voi che sapete\"&nbsp;(<em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>). I met Michelle this past summer in St. John's, and I heard some really exciting changes in her singing last night. In the Donizetti, she showed off her clean and warm top, and some juicy low notes to boot. Her Mozart was young and fresh-sounding, maybe a tiny bit less nervous. I was super happy for Michelle; she has all the stuff of an incredibly versatile and exciting mezzo-soprano sound.</p><p>Mezzo-soprano <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/exploreandlearn/newtoopera/onlinelearningcentre/parlandothecocblog.aspx?EntryID=46736\" target=\"_blank\">Zoe Band</a> showed off a lighter, brighter mezzo sound, and took on two cornerstone arias: \"Parto, parto, ma tu ben mio\" (<em>La clemenza di Tito</em>) and \"Must the Winter Come So Soon\" (<em>Vanessa</em>). In the Mozart, she showed really smart pacing of the taxing aria, and the affect was a more loving take on Sesto, rather than decisive. When Zoe got to those famous triplet runs near the end, she chose to keep it light (wise), but I felt she got off her voice a bit too much, and she needed a quicker tempo than was set up. In the Barber, I got to hear more of her long lines, which stretch and spin beautifully; I felt like she was holding her voice back, in position and in freedom, and it kept us from getting the full impact of her truly beautiful sound.</p><p><span data-sc-tag=\"[caption id=&quot;attachment_2233&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;456&quot;][/caption]\" class=\"sc-node sc-node-caption\"></span></p><p>The sole soprano in this year's competition, <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/exploreandlearn/newtoopera/onlinelearningcentre/parlandothecocblog.aspx?EntryID=46719\" target=\"_blank\">Eliza Johnson</a> finished off the night with gorgeous renditions of \"Padre, germani, addio\" (<em>Idomeneo</em>) and \"Je veux vivre\"&nbsp;(<em>Roméo et Juliette</em>). I'm a big fan of Eliza's; I think she's absolutely someone to watch in the coming years. Her Mozart was liquid and sobbing, but entirely clean and using the voice as the sole storytelling device. Her Juliette was some much-needed excitement after several slow-ish arias on the program, and she sang it with that young, fragile sound that's so important in this aria. The grace notes and the middle-voice writing throughout much of the aria was warm and graceful, and she climbed up to the top of her range with lots of focus and clarity. I loved her performance, and Eliza was also one of my top three picks.</p><p>While the judges deliberated, we got to hear a surprise performance by ridiculous Canadian soprano <a href=\"http://www.adriannepieczonka.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Adrienne Pieczonka</a>. I was in heaven as she sang&nbsp;\"Ebben, ne andrò lontana\" (<em>La Wally</em>), \"Pace, pace mio Dio!\" (<em>La forza del destino</em>), and Richard Strauss' gorgeous \"Zueignung\". It was a great performance, of course, and it was also great to hear a real pro sing after hearing the seven rising young singers. Adrienne's singing, so closely programmed to the finalists, gave us a really clear picture of what young singers strive to do, and what's possible when it comes to vocal development. Not a bad way to pass 15 minutes, I'd say.</p><p><span data-sc-tag=\"[caption id=&quot;attachment_2234&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;638&quot;][/caption]\" class=\"sc-node sc-node-caption\"></span></p><p>I thought this year's Centre Stage Gala had the right vibe to it, and I hope this is the precedent that is set for future years. The event was simple and well-paced, and I loved that the singers were able to sing both of their arias for the audience (in 2013, the public only got to hear their second selection). Ben Heppner was the best possible choice to host the gala; he's a graduate of the COC Ensemble Studio, and his humble, respectful air brought the event to a level of seriousness that the competitors really deserve.&nbsp;I disagreed with the final results of the competition (save for Charles Sy's First Prize and Audience Choice Award), but I know that there are factors in play beyond the finalists' singing last night. I had a great time watching, and I'm thrilled for the seven singers who got to do a really big thing: sing on the stage at the Four Seasons Centre. Bravi, guys.</p>",

        "body": "Verdi's _La traviata_ is one of those operas, like _Il barbiere di Siviglia_ or _Die Walküre_, that's so full of famous stories and tunes that the real significance of these moments is almost forgotten. But because it's Verdi, let's not dock him points for being obvious. I'm sure every opera fan has own favourite bits from _La traviata_, including the tragic first few bars, pictured above, that scream \"foreshadowing! Foreshadowing!\" very loudly in Italian. I chose a few musical moments that I feel act as dramatic checkpoints within the story of Violetta and her Alfredo.\n\n##Exhibit A:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428977902681/Traviata2.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nIf you don't know what this bit of music is, I won't say _shame on you_, but[ just click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ohegoq_IA) and get yourself up to speed. This drinking song is at the top of the show, the scene where we meet and get to know Violetta and Alfredo. Alfredo starts the song with a solo verse, and then the chorus join in. The song could essentially stop there, but the action halts, and Violetta picks up the second verse. There's nothing new or unique about the form Verdi uses in this number, and the tune is catchy because there aren't any surprising harmonies to throw you off. But there's something about the masculine _oom-pah-pah_ happening in the strings, about the build up of sound from solo tenor, to _tutti_ chorus, and then a deafening silence as Violetta keep the party going. Even her text, starting with \"Tra voi, tra voi saprò dividere il tempo mio giocondo\" (Or, \"I know how to share the fun between all of you\") sounds like it has gonads. The rolled R and syntactically doubled V in \"voi\" (thanks, Italian diction class!) make me think Violetta starts stomping in the big boots she was secretly wearing under her work attire. The way she sings to the room is full of confidence (perhaps too much?), and teasing, like when women wear men's suits and still look feminine. It's something about Violetta taking Alfredo's tune for her own; it's overt flirting, of course, on two levels. One is visible to the public, and the other is just for the two of them.\n\n##Exhibit B:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428977968429/TraviataGermont.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nThis is from Act II, which happens three months after the end of Act I. It's the fantastically incredible scene with Violetta and Germont, Alfredo's father. Germont comes to convince Violetta to leave his son, pulling all the best self-esteem jabs along the way. He plays the God card, and the make-it-her-problem card (\"Be an angel for our family\"). Above, he's playing the vanity card: \"One day, when the fire is gone, he'll get bored. Then what?\" Now, I'm sure a good dramaturg _could_ make the case that Germont has some good intentions in this scene. But I always winced at how he constantly assumes that Alfredo couldn't _really_ love Violetta, probably because she's an escort. He does it here, in those snakey little voice quavers that Verdi writes, on the scariest words like \"lust\" and \"fled\" and \"feelings\". The classic _oom-pah_ sounds like a good ghost story is about to unfold, and Germont tells the whole thing . What a dirty move, to tell a woman whose looks are her means that she has nothing to offer when she ages. You can hear him talking down to her. And it's the worst, because he probably thinks he's doing a good deed. Villains, right?\n\n##Exhibit C:\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428978017744/TraviataEnd3.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nThis is from Violetta's third act aria, \"Addio del passato\", when she's sick, alone, and almost broke. She starts the aria remembering her life, and grieving its near end. It's a simple aria (yet not simple to sing), and simplicity is always the best way to make small changes feel massive. Like when it moves heartbreakingly from minor to major, in the top line of the above score. She asks God to smile upon her as she dies, a big ask for sex worker in 19th-century Italy. It's that whole thing where watching someone cry doesn't pack the same punch as watching someone try not to cry. I wouldn't say La traviata is about Violetta's relationship with God, but her sense of self-worth are major factors in her life decisions (sound familiar, anyone?). So when she escapes the natural minor key of her aria, and moves briefly into that sunny, upwards-looking major key, it makes me think of desperation and real hope. She also refers to herself as \"la traviata\", the fallen woman; she must believe it to be true, because she mentions it almost as a caveat to her asking God's forgiveness. Ugh. That Violetta believes herself to be a fallen woman is the saddest part, I think.\n\n##Exhibit Obligatory\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428978149641/TraviataEnd.jpg)\n</figure>\n\nThis is from Violetta's third act aria, \"Addio del passato\", when she's sick, alone, and almost broke.

It was fantastic, but I'm hardly the unbiased media figure I should be in order to offer up a true review. <a href=\"http://atg.schmopera.com/\" target=\"_blank\">I joined the AtG team in Banff this summer</a>, as they collaborated with the Canadian Opera Company and Parks Canada to first present <em>#UncleJohn&nbsp;</em>at the Cave and Basin National Historic Site. The project was new for everyone, and the rehearsal room was a special place during that summer workshop. There were little details to iron out, both musical and dramatic, and so it was one of those stimulating processes of creative thinking and openness that most artists dream of.<p></p><p>Joel is all about the audience's experience, and that translates into unconventional venues&nbsp;(like outdoor spaces subject to rain, mosquitoes, and sulphur) and extraordinary&nbsp;demands on the mechanics of opera (like the&nbsp;<em>AtG Messiah</em> chorus performing from memory, or managing&nbsp;Mozart <em>recit</em>&nbsp;without any singer-conductor sight lines). The AtG creative team tends to work with&nbsp;a wild idea, and enough open minds around to try it out;&nbsp;the award-winning company&nbsp;has had full of successes from the beginning. All these unknown elements are hovering in the air throughout the whole rehearsal process, including the first performance, and no one really knows how they'll all settle.&nbsp;There's always a bit of alchemy that happens on AtG shows, in my own experience working with their team.&nbsp;<em>#UncleJohn</em> in Banff was an incredible mix of good energy amongst the team, green and responsive audiences, and an unforgettable venue. The reward for all that creative work was enormous.</p><p><span data-sc-tag=\"[caption id=&quot;attachment_2320&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;1498&quot;][/caption]\" class=\"sc-node sc-node-caption\"></span></p><p>For <em>#UncleJohn</em>&nbsp;in Toronto, I was around briefly during the rehearsal process (and of course, to get an <a href=\"/unclejohn-in-toronto/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Joel and&nbsp;Miloš</a>), so the production wasn't entirely new to me when I saw it on Thursday night.&nbsp;I remember seeing real excitement and awe in the audience during the Banff shows, and it was neat to experience it for myself. I got to hear the effect of opera singers scattered around an open space,&nbsp;how different corners of the audience heard different sides to all the ensemble numbers, and how the cast seemed to like popping up behind you without warning (*cough, Leporello). I looked up with empathy at&nbsp;Miloš and the <a href=\"http://againstthegraintheatre.com/artists/542c0d5d0082a2f920000018\" target=\"_blank\">Cecilia Quartet</a>, hopelessly out of view of the singers, and marvelled at how the thing relentlessly held together. I know a good chunk&nbsp;of the cast well, especially in these roles; even so, there were things I had never seen before, and the novelty managed to outweigh any sense of \"been there, done that\".</p><p>What I heard between my brief time in rehearsal and opening night was on par with the&nbsp;amazing process that happens organically at Against the Grain. This <em>#UncleJohn&nbsp;</em>was as different as it could have, and should have been. The <a href=\"http://www.thegreathall.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">new venue</a>&nbsp;called for an entire re-design by Patrick DuWors (sets and costumes) and Jason Hand (lighting), and Joel made some changes in his libretto to fit Toronto audiences. But the coolest part was the cast. About half of the singers were new to this production, and just like the cast in Banff, they took on their roles&nbsp;as&nbsp;if they were versions of themselves. They were true to the dialogue and score (I know that much well), but they found something real about these <em>very</em> old characters.</p><p><span data-sc-tag=\"[caption id=&quot;attachment_2323&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;1500&quot;][/caption]\" class=\"sc-node sc-node-caption\"></span></p><p>It seems like an obvious result of hiring great artists to be in your show, but it's more special than that. I work with a lot of singers, and a truly organic performance is a hard achievement; they don't happen that often. But here, over just two productions of&nbsp;<em>#UncleJohn</em>, it had happened&nbsp;<em>twice</em>. That's a rare thing, you know. It's certainly a testament to Canadian artists, and to the audience-considerate approach of Against the Grain Theatre. I think it's also a testament to opera; that&nbsp;<em>Don Giovanni</em>, for example, can travel through transformations of language and orchestration and still move people.&nbsp;<em>#UncleJohn</em> shows us that opera is not dependent on large theatres or full orchestras, and that the best operas aren't even dependent on specificity of text.&nbsp;I think opera is dependent on its artists, specifically the ones that can deliver a meaningful performance without distance, ideal acoustics, and distractingly elaborate sets. Within less than a year, I saw two groups of singers&nbsp;collectively evolve this show and its people.&nbsp;If artists like these aren't so rare after all, perhaps the responsibility lies in the hands of the directors and conductors to step back and watch them.</p>",

Cecilia is known for her singing of Mozart, Vivaldi, and plenty of long-lost songs from the 18th-century and earlier. Early Music folks are notoriously eccentric, and at their worst, <a href=\"http://www.earlymusicworld.com/id44.html\" target=\"_blank\">annoyingly closed-minded</a> about \"modern music\". I didn't picture Ceci for one to turn up their nose at music outside of her usual repertoire, but here's <a href=\"http://www.gramilano.com/2014/10/cecilia-bartoli-contemporary-composers-cant-write-opera-singers-like/\" target=\"_blank\">this quote</a> of hers:<p></p><p>\"I’ve always enjoyed research, try­ing to find for­got­ten music to enlarge the rep­er­toire, being that con­tem­por­ary com­posers can’t seem to write for opera sing­ers like me. It would be won­der­ful to work with a com­poser writ­ing for [sic] just for us. Moz­art wrote his operas know­ing the voices of the sing­ers who would inter­pret the roles. Today, it’s no longer like that: atonal music cre­ates a bar­rier between com­poser and singer, so in order to find new music to sing I have to search in the past.\"</p><p>Let's take this one sentence at a time. Enlarging the known repertoire certainly doesn't just mean writing more contemporary music; searching for unfamiliar music of the past is completely legit. But, \"contemporary composers can't seem to write for opera singers like me\"? Really? I mean, I'm thinking of someone like Dawn Upshaw, similar in voice, and a serious champion of new music. I hope Cecilia isn't playing the special-snowflake-<em>fach</em> card, because it just doesn't fly. She skips right on past the solution to this non-problem in her second sentence: \"It would be wonderful to work with a composer...\" So do it? Work with a living composer, and educate him or her about what makes good vocal writing, about the natural demands and limitations of different voices.</p><p>Does Cecilia really think that the composer-singer relationship stopped after Mozart? Apparently so: \"Mozart wrote his operas knowing the voices of the singers who would interpret the roles.\" First of all, these singers may have been bad singers. Besides&nbsp;anecdotal knowledge that's handy to have in the rehearsal process, who cares? More importantly, composers have been writing for singers they know for as long as there have been composers and singers. I mean, there's <a href=\"http://www.brittenpears.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears</a>, <a href=\"http://www.festivalopera.org/curtin.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Carlisle Floyd and Phyllis Curtin</a>, <a href=\"http://florentschmitt.com/2014/08/19/french-soprano-denise-duval-muse-of-francis-poulenc-friend-of-florent-schmitt/\" target=\"_blank\">Francis Poulenc and Denis Duval</a>, and of course,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini#Marriage_and_affairs\" target=\"_blank\">Puccini and all his mistresses</a>. And to drive a point home, Dawn Upshaw has made a name for herself working with composers like Saariaho, Golijov, Adams, and Herbison.</p><p>It's in the last bit of that quote where I think the real point lies. The whole&nbsp;\"atonal music cre­ates a bar­rier between com­poser and singer\" thing is just such an old thing to say. Atonality has nothing to do with any barriers that may exist between what's written and what can be well-sung in practicality. I remember seeing Verdi's&nbsp;<em>Stiffelio</em> at VOICEBOX/Opera in Concert earlier this year, thinking the whole time that it was written uncomfortably for the three lead roles. There's Richard Strauss, who ran a gamut of compositional styles, including atonality. People like singing Strauss and find his music&nbsp;expressive, engaging and narrative. There are also Stravinsky and Berg and Britten and others writing well for voices in questionable keys. I also found this bit of hilarity from <a href=\"http://sk-sk.pchelplinebd.comwww.fb.me/sally.whitwell.musician/posts/770322526337076?comment_id=770736606295668&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=17\" target=\"_blank\">Sally Whitwell</a>'s posting of Cecilia's statement on her Facebook page:</p><p><span data-sc-tag=\"[caption id=&quot;attachment_2335&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;][/caption]\" class=\"sc-node sc-node-caption\"></span></p><p>I'll admit firstly that I'm not in Cecilia's vocal shoes; I'm not even a singer. Perhaps I'm being unfair, offering up examples of contemporary music that I understand to be vocally well-written. I'll also admit that when it comes to what she wants to sing, Cecilia has as much right as any other singer. She's earned herself an enviable career with her clearly passionate singing of difficult rep (I still can't get over <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rISjBGOtHhs\" target=\"_blank\">her Vivaldi coloratura</a>). My objections to her statements may come simply from a difference in taste. However, I can't shake the feeling that Cecilia, whether or not she's aware of it, wants composers to write music that sounds like the stuff she already prefers to sing. I guess that falls under taste. I'm just surprised that's how she feels.</p><p>Contemporary singers, what say you? How does newly written music stack up to the singability of Mozart and his friends? Are today's composers irreverent of the singer's task? Is Cecilia Bartoli right?</p>",

        "body": "<p>In opera&nbsp;circles, one of the beloved stories of innocent lay-person ignorance is the old chestnut: \"Oh you're&nbsp;an opera singer? Can you sing&nbsp;something for me right now?\" The implication of this hypothetical, that it's utterly ridiculous to ask an opera singer to demonstrate his or her skills, is really telling of characteristics unique to classical musicians. For trained opera singers, the concept of spontaneity is, for some reason, unwelcome.</p><p>Although it may be the easiest for singers to demonstrate&nbsp;their skills for&nbsp;curious water-coolerites (a phlegm check and a good breath can be enough to show off one's best high notes), the aversion to spontaneity is a common trait across classical music disciplines. As a young pianist, I was nervous&nbsp;to play for family and friends on a whim, and didn't do it all that much. I was aware that I had put much time and effort and love into the piano, I feared my little pop-up concert wouldn't do any of it&nbsp;justice. Conversely, my brother first learned to play guitar by ear (he has a naturally great ear, by the way). That may not be the common reason&nbsp;for hesitancy amongst classical musicians, but it's certainly a trait found less in artists of other genres.</p><p>Of course, my brother and I aren't representative&nbsp;of all&nbsp;other musicians who work either in or&nbsp;outside of the Classical genre, but in my own experience with musicians, this sort of difference temperament is generally on par. So why are classically trained musicians less spontaneous with their skill? Why don't more opera singers, for example, jump at the chance for an impromptu, off-the-cuff performance upon request? As a pianist myself, I used to tell myself that I was off the hook for plenty of these unplanned \"performance opportunities\" because the piano itself isn't very portable. But that excuse doesn't fly for flautists or violinists, and it definitely doesn't hold weight around singers, who bring their instrument everywhere they go by default.</p><p>Opera singers have spoken to me in the past about this conundrum. There seems to be a lot of focus on the risk of vocal health versus the potential gain of applause. An unexpected show probably means that the singer won't have time for their usual warm-up, along with a myriad of other unknown factors like acoustics and available pianists for accompaniment. Plenty of singers, understandably, don't want to risk unhealthy singing by foregoing their technical process for the sake of some demanding party guests. But are opera singers, like other classical musicians, held captive by&nbsp;the long list of variables that need to be in order for them to practice their craft?</p><p>A working singer's list probably includes the aforementioned warm-up routine, a pianist and a conversation with said pianist, and a knowledge of the space acoustics. I think there are two more pieces to the puzzle, in which the real problem lies. The first seems petty, but it isn't: small spaces stress out opera singers. I'm not talking black-box-theatre small, I'm talking your aunt's kitchen or living-room small. In close quarters, singers can feel like they need to make a choice between using their \"full voice\" and perhaps deafening their friends and family, or shrinking away from their full sound and exacerbating the above concern about vocal health.</p><p>Finally, there's the question of context. Why are all these people here? Is it for a concert or concert-like event, in which case one can assume that everyone who is there wants to hear music? Or is it a random social gathering, mixed with people who are curious about the Classical Musician in their midst, and people who really&nbsp;don't care? If it's the second case, there's an enormous risk of performing for an unwilling or apathetic audience. I'm sure any musician would tell me that he detests that idea, and I think classical musicians are even more tender about it. In the case of opera singers, I don't blame them. It's a pretty vulnerable thing, to sing for people in close proximity, let alone to sing for people who didn't come to this party to hear opera. Ouch.</p><p>In all honesty, these hypothetical events are usually a low-risk environment for impromptu concerts. The audience of curious friends and acquaintances will most likely be impressed with our performance, regardless of the disproportionate standards we hold privately for ourselves. So why do we so often feel that spontaneous shows don't really exemplify our skill? Do we feel as though we need to communicate to our audience the hours upon hours of work put into what they're hearing?</p><p>Perhaps this timid-seeming temperament of classical musicians comes from the way they were trained.&nbsp;We're educated over long periods of time and in very formalized ways; much like professional athletes, we put in hours of training that are grossly disproportionate to the hours spent in performance. I think it's fair to say that musicians who work in jazz, blues, Irish fiddle music, etc., get onstage more often and earlier than classical musicians. Gigs in bars, jam sessions, fumbling around by ear on a guitar, are all hugely educational for any musician; players and singers can learn how to make music as a group, how to lead and follow, how to take a solo and how to accompany, and how to do it all in front of an audience. In an opposite approach, classical musicians are generally taught to practice first, and perform the finished product later. Imperfection in public is not a big part of our training, and the values of improvisation are often overlooked.</p><p>But, you know, there really&nbsp;<em>is</em> something different about so-called classical music. Compared to pop, rock, and a lot of jazz, the music is more complicated, and it demands more technical facility. The pieces we perform exist independently of our particular interpretation, and the act of writing music is held at a high value. When singers turn down an invitation to show off their chops, it may be &nbsp;justified; it may be true that our music deserves a certain&nbsp;ceremony around its performance, to match the effort that went into writing it in the first place.</p><p>In the spirit of fairness, I present to you an example of what can happen when classically trained musicians have the skill and freedom to improvise. For&nbsp;an encore, violinist Anton Kontra leads pianist and comedian&nbsp;Victor Borge through <a href=\"http://imslp.org/wiki/Cs%C3%A1rd%C3%A1s_%28Monti,_Vittorio%29\" target=\"_blank\">Monti's Czárdás</a>. The fun part: Victor hadn't played the piece before. This makes me smile more than most things.</p><p><figure data-type=\"video\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/tvUbrbFdJ8g\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></figure></p>",

Can you sing something for me right now?” The implication of this hypothetical, that it’s utterly ridiculous to ask an opera singer to demonstrate his or her skills, is really telling of characteristics unique to classical musicians. For trained opera singers, the concept of spontaneity is, for some reason, unwelcome."

        "body": "Sunday, December 21st was 2014's Winter Soltice, and it was an apt day to head over to Massey Hall and hear [Tafelmusik's 28th annual Sing-Along _Messiah_](http://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/concert/sing-along-messiah-massey-hall). I had actually never been to a Sing-Along _Messiah_, save for the obligatory singing-along of the Hallelujah Chorus at all the other _Messiahs_ I've seen. So it was really neat for me to turn off of Yonge St. and see a crowd of people outside the theatre, plenty of them clutching a Novello edition of Handel's _Messiah_ under their arm. Toronto _Messiah_-goers come prepared. I opted for trusting my memory with the choruses instead, although I'll admit to sneaking a glance at my neighbour's score on a few occasions.\n\nTafelmusik's Sing-Along _Messiah_ is like a show about the _Messiah_. It's great. [Ivars Taurins](http://www.tafelmusik.org/about/choir/bios/ivars-taurins), director of the Tafelmusik Chamber Choir, donned a powdered wig and some Baroque apparel (see photo above!) to embody George Friedrich Handel himself. In beloved and unwavering character, \"George\" acted as conductor, emcee, historian, and cheerleader, both for the extraordinary Tafelmusik [Baroque Orchestra](http://www.tafelmusik.org/about/orchestra) and [Chamber Choir](http://www.tafelmusik.org/about/choir), and for the packed house of amateur choristers. His thick German accent made quotable quotes, like \"I'm so hip it hurts!\", extra hilarious (\"I'm zo heep it hooertz!\"). He conducted with wild flails and oversized jabs in the general direction of the next entry; it was fantastic, and it reminded me of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX1ljYx3g3k&t=0m50s). Amid the exaggerated show of it all, there were true musicians onstage to make it all work. Ivars conducted with an abandon that spoke of a deep understanding of the score of Handel's _Messiah_; it was clear to me that he and the Tafelmusik ensemble were absolute pros, having fun with a piece they know inside and out. Frankly, Ivars-als-Handel emanated a love for the piece that was infectious.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428876519301/TeuscherFeb2014.jpg)\n<figcaption>Soprano Lydia Teuscher.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFour great soloists joined Tafelmusik for this _Messiah_: soprano [Lydia Teuscher](http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/singers/soprano/lydia-teuscher), countertenor [James Laing](http://jamesblackmanagement.com/artists/category/countertenors/james-laing), tenor [Colin Balzer](http://www.maierartists.de/colin-balzer-en.html), and baritone [Brett Polegato](http://www.brettpolegato.com/). Their sounds were complementary, keeping a cohesive sound palate throughout the night. Colin's \"Comfort Ye\" was sweet and strong, and I think he liked singing the aria as much as I like to hear it. I thought he got a bit shy up top, and wondered if he was feeling 100%. I was glad they didn't cut his aria, \"But thou didst not leave\", because it's one of my favourite bits.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428876552778/James-Laing.jpg)\n<figcaption>Countertenor James Laing.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nJames Laing sang with clean beauty and lots of soul; his (long) aria \"He was despised\" got cut short, but I loved what he was doing and could have heard the whole thing. Lydia Teuscher had a bright, gentle sound and lots of speed for those famously tricky melismas in \"Rejoice greatly\". Brett Polegato was my favourite, I think. He had tons of energy, and took huge bites out of the great text in those bass arias, delivering his performance more operatically than oratorio-esque. His \"The trumpet shall sound\" was wicked, albeit a little wild, but props go to the baritone who can keep focus on himself with Handel himself waving along a few feet away. Bravo, Brett!\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428876627204/Brett_Polegato_portrait.jpg)\n<figcaption>Baritone Brett Polegato.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n_Messiah_ was a great musical experience, with tons of expertise up onstage. I'll tell you a bit about the moments of novelty and laughs I had from my spot amongst the Singers-Along. There were _so many_ Christmas sweaters, and more Santa hats than I expected. Behind me and to my right was an enthusiastic tenor, whom I later overheard had just done a performance of _Messiah_ himself last week, confirming my suspicions. There was the lady directly to my right who struggled first with opening a bag of Miss Vickie's chips, and then an apparently child-proof tin of breathmints. It struck me that the Sing-Along concept brings out the worst in audiences. You give an audience an inch (like getting them all to stand up for every chorus), and they take a mile (like unusual amounts of mob-like chatter between numbers and too much applause for my Puritan liking). Audiences are animals. But as Handel, conductor Ivars Taurins got the best out of us all. In quasi-Deutsch, he scolded our sloppy score-reading \"It's zwei 'shall be's'! Zwei!!\", and motivated our repeated text \"Hallelujah! Was??? HALLELUJAH!!\"\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428876721825/Colin-Balzer-Feb-2014_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Baritone Brett Polegato.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nPersonal note: I also brought my dad to this _Messiah_, partly because he sang bass in the chorus for it when he was younger, and partly because he laughs when I softly \"bahhh\" in the \"All we like sheep\" chorus (thanks, [Against the Grain Theatre](http://www.againstthegraintheatre.com/shows/messiah)).\n\nIt struck me that the mood in Massey Hall on Sunday was one that Handel hoped would come with his _Messiah_. Tafelmusik, Handel, and the whole audience joined forces to remind me of the real joy that comes out of the music and the message. I say bravo to Tafelmusik's long-standing tradition of the[ Sing-Along _Messiah_](http://www.tafelmusik.org/concert-calendar/concert/sing-along-messiah-massey-hall); 10/10, would Sing-Along again.",

Neither Gilbert nor Sullivan show up frequently on my list of must-sees, due to personal taste and perhaps too many earworms (#iamtheverymodelofamodernmajorgeneral). But I had much faith (and a few friends) in the Canadian cast, and I absolutely wasn't disappointed. Now, I'm no expert in the hidden political commentary and layers of meaning that I know exist in good G&amp;S, and in the case of <em>The Mikado</em>, I tend to get hung up on the exaggerated Japanesery and tackiness of the whole story. Not to mention the endless pentatonic scales in the score that sounded like bits from <em>Madama Butterfly</em>; I reminded myself that when Western composers limit themselves to the \"five Asian pitches\", they limit their options for melodic originality. I'll put my quibbles with the show itself aside, because it was clear that this production was not trying to tell a true story of actual people in Japan. TOT General Director <a href=\"http://www.torontooperetta.com/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">Guillermo Silva-Marin</a> clearly knew that exaggeration is one's ticket out of the shroud of a dated piece like <em>The Mikado</em>. The giggling gaggle of Japanese girls, the archaic reverence to the Mikado (ah! Mikado!), it was all clearly overdone to the point of freeing the artists from the elements in the show that can make today's audiences squirm.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of the artists: as Nanki-Poo, tenor \n\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aitkramer\" target=\"_blank\">Adrian Kramer</a> sounded fantastic. He sang with his full voice, which was round and even from top to bottom. He had throaty qualities as his rose higher (which I loved), and it gave him a bit of an Italian-tenor sound; he also had moments of real vocal risk to get a wide palate of colours. I always love when the tenor's full voice isn't his only trick. Adrian's voice filled out the leading role with command, and it mixed hilariously with his cartoon-like faces, slapstick comedy, and demeanour that was young and loveable.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Nanki-Poo's love Yum-Yum, soprano \n\t<a href=\"http://luciacesaroni.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lucia Cesaroni</a> was wide-eyed, bubbly and adorable; I think she had my favourite entrance by a soprano that I've seen in a long time, filling the hall with deafening shrieks of excitement upon seeing her friends. She sang beautifully too. I'm a huge fan of Lucia's voice, with its warmth and darkness and surprising ease up top. Yum-Yum doesn't give a soprano much room for line, save for her Act II aria, \"The sun whose rays are all ablaze\". Lucia sang that with gorgeous evenness and soul in her sound, and even tackled the finnicky, awkwardly-high bits in her many ensemble numbers. Like Adrian, Lucia commanded attention with her voice, and offered up a Yum-Yum who was charming, simple, and young. The two of them together were so freaking cute, in that way that nerds are so freaking cute together. They were goofy and passionate, as Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum were not only each other's true loves, but also best friends and partners in crime. Aww.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428854894043/156-copy_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7ciyg9HkJW4evejfdK71jiWQblDe1qchq30__x1uaf6dNpmoBdybk8Iraf8c_9WFqZZDghfcDsZsRBFe5jtrrVFmUhb0\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7ciyg9HkJW4evejfdK71jiWQblDe1qchq30__x1uaf6dNpmoBdybk8Iraf8c_9WFqZZDghfcDsZsRBFe5jtrrVFmUhb0=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Adrian Kramer (Nanki-Poo) and Lucia Cesaroni (Yum-Yum)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tAnother standout for me was bass-baritone \n\t<a href=\"http://www.gilestomkins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Giles Tomkins</a> as the Mikado. I've always loved Giles' voice, but I don't think I'd ever seen him in anything funny before. He had a booming clarity when he sang, giving him due authority to go with his tall (and wide, thanks to his costume!) presence. His speaking voice was just as satisfying, but I loved best his fantastic, quasi-evil belly laugh that happened right after the line about \".....elliptical billiard balls!!\" Giles was a real pro and it was fantastic to see him in this role that seemed to bring out some of his best onstage qualities.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTenor \n\t<a href=\"http://www.torontooperetta.com/artists.html\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Angelo</a> sang Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner, and the man who's supposed to marry Yum-Yum. He was great with all his moments of slapstick comedy, acting as a proper foil to Adrian's Nanki-Poo. Vocally, the role seemed low for Joseph, and at times he got drowned out by the orchestra. His aria about eugenics, \"I've got a little list\" was missing some oomph, some threat to it. I missed some of his text, too, however he had a knack for physicalizing his lines as much as he could, so I didn't miss much of the intention. As the old, scorned daughter-in-law-elect of the Mikado, Katisha, mezzo-soprano <a href=\"http://www.mialennoxwilliams.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mia Lennox</a> sang with a rich and warm sound and an enviable low register. Katisha is a big sing, exposing plenty of technical prowess, and Mia filled out the role with a really lovely sound. I had trouble getting her text, too, taking away from the gravity of Katisha's story in the show.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Pooh-Bah, the Lord High Everything Else, \n\t<a href=\"http://www.torontooperetta.com/artists.html\" target=\"_blank\">David Ludwig</a> was hilarious. He seemed the most at home with the G&amp;S style, both in how he sang, and in how he negotiated his complicated dialogue (that I bet was a bitch to memorize). Despite the writing for Pooh-Bah being mostly ensemble and patter work, David grew on me as a singer throughout the show. He kind of reminded me of the Tom Allen School of G&amp;S (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlOb0XMxt84\" target=\"_blank\">watch and learn</a>). My man <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregory_finney\" target=\"_blank\">Gregory Finney</a> was funny and sobering as Pish-Tush. He sang with that big, surprising voice of his, and kept the clarity throughout his patter with serious skill. Greg is always great for making sense of the nonsense that keeps popping up in operetta. I died when he won the onstage game and anachronistically raised both fists triumphantly. He also gets bonus points with Adrian Kramer for best handling of an onstage snafu that I've ever seen (Greg's fan broke, and Adrian didn't miss a beat passing him a new one). <a href=\"http://www.torontooperetta.com/artists.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brittany King</a> and<a href=\"http://www.torontooperetta.com/artists.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Daria Bukhman</a> were lovely as Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo, two of the little maids from school.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428854929517/101-copy_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/X_4ZtMkKDglB0UoXo1leOF8x0jeF4rOncUX2Uu2pnu3NOI7drNGrsEKiaX8e-WQiRAa0wpNR4TGrtdJPKJxg8wIdENk\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/X_4ZtMkKDglB0UoXo1leOF8x0jeF4rOncUX2Uu2pnu3NOI7drNGrsEKiaX8e-WQiRAa0wpNR4TGrtdJPKJxg8wIdENk=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Joseph Angelo (Ko-Ko) and David Ludwing (Pooh-Bah)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tThe Ensemble was well-coached by music director and conductor \n\t<a href=\"http://www.operabase.com/a/Derek_Bate\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Bate</a>; nice harmonic and textual clarity. I especially loved the ladies' entrance. The orchestra sounded great, tackling some tricky-sounding bits that I hadn't remembered before. The sets were suggestive of environment without being too vague; plenty of red and pretty parasols created the world of <em>The Mikado</em> clearly. I thought some of the choreography was a bit awkward and unmusical, and there were a few prop mishaps that amused me, although perhaps for the wrong reasons. I'd say that the skill of the cast carries the production, which had the feeling of a remount.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The Mikado</em> plays until January 4th, including a fancy-schmancy New Year's Eve performance, complete with pre-show food and drink and midnight champagne.

He spoke about Handel's sense of charity, of his understanding of women's suffering during wartime, and about valuing the arts. It was a densely inspiring talk that extended to these young listeners a deep understanding of the arts' role in today's culture.\n</p>\n<h3>2. <a href=\"http://atg.schmopera.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Working on <em>#UncleJohn </em>in Banff</a></h3>\n<p>\n\tI joined Against the Grain Theatre at The Banff Centre to work on Joel Ivany's new piece, <em>#UncleJohn</em>. It's the second in Joel's original libretti for the three Mozart/Da Ponte operas, starting with <em>Figaro's Wedding</em> and rounding out with the upcoming <i>A Little Too Cozy</i>. The team, the location, and the project were all inspiring, and it made for a pretty fantastic summer.

We met out at the beautiful Banff Centre, and we picked each other's brain about librettos (wondering about Mozart's text repetition, etc.). We talking about writing words not to be spoken, but to be sung. He was an enlightening person to meet, piquing my curiosity about <em>Hadrian</em> to new heights.\n</p>\n<h3>4. <a href=\"/nicole-brooks-on-obeah-opera/\" target=\"_blank\">When I saw <em>Obeah Opera</em></a></h3>\n<p>\n\tI went with Greg to a workshop performance of Nicole Brook's <em>Obeah Opera</em>, the \"a cappella theatrical epic\" which tells the story of Black slave women and their fates during the Salem Witch Trials. The story is a heavy one even on paper, but I wasn't prepared for the experience of it live. The women in this ensemble piece showed a rare example of a group's unity, of <em>oneness</em>, both musical and narrative. You know how the absolute best shows are sometimes hard to describe? Unfortunately for you, readers, <em>Obeah</em> was one of those. Greg could probably vouch for me, though, judging by his emotional state at the show's end.\n</p>\n<h3>5. <a href=\"/go-canada/\" target=\"_blank\">When I heard top-notch Canadian music, performed by Canadians.</a></h3>\n<p>\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.canadianartsongproject.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Art Song Project</a> brought its hard work and skillful artists to the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, showcasing a collection of songs by Canadian composers. I was moved by artists like Monica Whicher and Kathryn Tremills, and excited about the additions to the ever-growing Canadian musical canon.\n</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><strong>Greg:</strong></h2>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1: <a href=\"/falstaff-he-saidshe-said/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Carsen's <em>Falstaff</em></a></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">Grabbing top honours for me this year, has to be the Canadian Opera Company's production of Verdi's <em>Falstaff</em>. This opera holds a special place in my heart. I was in a production years ago and that experience is what pushed me into this glorious career. Seeing such a stunning performance of this masterpiece reaffirmed in me as an artist why I do this to begin with. The singing was phenomenal - to hear Finley sing Falstaff is probably one of the best things that could have happened to this young baritone. It was brilliant. Mistress Quickly (Marie Nicole Lemieux) taught us all how to be a pro, and actually all the singers knocked this one out of the park - I only felt that Russell Braun may have been a little miscast, but that was really my only issue with the entire production. I still have wet dreams about that kitchen. </span>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428853035735/Falstaff-MC-0733R.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K0EztgekyKpPTeOmSAvOwZTSd6-U0rLdQPK5ksBkte28f-LpCk-2cAdVlSqC4L-SmjYwVakSMmsIuoOxCel4EeuXBFXgeQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K0EztgekyKpPTeOmSAvOwZTSd6-U0rLdQPK5ksBkte28f-LpCk-2cAdVlSqC4L-SmjYwVakSMmsIuoOxCel4EeuXBFXgeQ=s1200\"></a><figcaption>\"The Kitchen,\" from Robert Carsen's <em>Falstaff</em> at the COC.

I tend to disagree. We had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7etXoNrwP8c\" target=\"_blank\">Renée Fleming sing the American National Anthem at the Superbowl</a> and SLAY it. It's a difficult song to sing at the best of times, never mind the thought of having singers doing it (at such high profile events) who really don't have the range required for this arduous piece. Renée knocked it out of the park, literally reminding Americans (and the rest of us) what their national anthem SHOULD sound like (not everybody is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_lCmBvYMRs\"><span class=\"s2\">Whitney</span></a>). Even Major League Baseball upheld the status quo on this one and asked the awesomesauce <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciDE-3p4hNQ\" target=\"_blank\">Joyce DiDonato to sing the anthem for the World Series</a>. It's nice not only to think that we're past the hijinks of the likes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkhbpeL-8sY\"><span class=\"s2\">Roseanne Barr</span></a> and moving into an area where even the commonest of denominators love hearing a properly trained voice.</span>\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3: <a href=\"/in-review-pelleas-et-melisande/\" target=\"_blank\">AtG's Pelléas et Mélisande</a></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">What an eye-opener is Against the Grain Theatre. I've been blessed to work with them on some amazing projects (<em>La bohème, Figaro's Wedding, AtG's Messiah, #UncleJohn</em>). Joel Ivany's creative mind is exactly what we all need in this industry to keep us ALL revitalized. This production of Debussy's only opera was stunning, and couldn't be more perfect. Sung outside in a beautiful garden space with occasional natural accompaniment of the wee birdies hiding amongst the ivies and trees. We were introduced to the lovely Andrea Nùñez and I fell head over heels for French baritone Etienne Dupuis. If you have a chance to hear this guy, run - don't walk. You'll fall just as hard. #tripleswoontimesinfinity.</span>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428853130519/blockd-2869.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UazpYiJ0AW9MWyOTR56fNGP0a6c6e_s7vzdxKmiE2VSTYXzr0WrboAhWaZHbYFmYj-v78Hum5jiQQ9k4xFs2K2LTDGM\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UazpYiJ0AW9MWyOTR56fNGP0a6c6e_s7vzdxKmiE2VSTYXzr0WrboAhWaZHbYFmYj-v78Hum5jiQQ9k4xFs2K2LTDGM=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Etienne Dupuis as Pelléas in AtG's <em>Pelléas et Mélisande</em>.

We heard from<a href=\"/may-she-never-work-again/\" target=\"_blank\"> Tamar Iveri</a> (via her Facebook page), comparing the LGBT community to feces and a scourge that should be eradicated. She claimed the words were her husband's, not hers - colour me \"not convinced\" (#bigot). <a href=\"/valerian-ruminski-or-those-who-forget-the-past-are-doomed-to-repeat-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruminski</a> followed not long after, tweeting some incredibly hate-filled words directed at a young man headed to Ottawa Pride. That's right, this one went down on our home turf. Canada. The world leader in acceptance had its reputation besmirched by the hiring of someone who can't keep his personal opinions personal. After just seeing the film <em>Into the Woods</em>, I kind of want to rewrite \"Children Will Listen\" to include \"careful the posts you posts, people can see them\"</span>\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">5: <a href=\"http://www.nycorenaissance.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NYCO pulling a phoenix</a></span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">For over 70 years, New York City Opera was bringing delicious, creative productions to New York fans, and in October of 2013 they had to close their doors and filed for bankruptcy. New York City Opera claims to be the ones to have made stars of Plácido Domingo, Beverly Sills, Samuel Ramey and Jose Carreras (2 of The Three Tenors ain't bad). We were all still mourning the death of this cultural treasure when news broke of the New York City Opera Renaissance, a foundation dedicated to returning New York City Opera back to the moniker of \"The People's Opera\". They've applied to take over the company and (I believe) are just waiting on the final ruling of the bankruptcy courts. All signs point to us having this great company back on its feet. <a href=\"http://www.nycorenaissance.com/\"><span class=\"s2\">Plans are already running</span></a> to have them back onstage for us in 2015. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1 intro\">\n\tHave a wonderful New Year, readers! I hope a soprano is within earshot of tonight's Auld Lang Syne. Oh, who am I kidding? They're always within earshot. Cheers, and see you in 2015!\n</p>",

He describes the stormy weather, the shortage of drinking water for him and the boy. He tells Blstrode about how \"the boy's silent reproach turned to illness\", and how Peter came home in the boat alone. Look on the score above at the setting of the word \"alone\". The interval is a painful minor ninth, leaning on that F-natural and finally wailing up to a high A. The word \"alone\" of course applies to Peter's lack of company upon returning the boat; but when set the way Britten does, it's got to mean more. \"Alone\" starts to sound like \"I am alone\" in the more depressing, broad sense. It's Peter's mourning of what happened that day; it might just be his aloneness that will keep him a villain in the eyes of The Borough. More on that topic:\n</p>\n<h4>Exhibit B:</h4>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428852465602/PeterGrimes5.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UNnZwhSNfV39XovaY2_DYZYkzq3YqCJtw71V4ALSA6-J3jNplrnEgswpE6AOj71G2T1OJT8Ur1s4ePwmFE2dJpgAd8\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UNnZwhSNfV39XovaY2_DYZYkzq3YqCJtw71V4ALSA6-J3jNplrnEgswpE6AOj71G2T1OJT8Ur1s4ePwmFE2dJpgAd8=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tThis is from the end of that entrancing scene near the end of Act I, where Peter walks into the town pub and starts babbling about the stars and the nighttime. I paraphrase very much, but he asks a question, \"Can one ever undo a moment in one's life?\" This aria is written largely on the Peter Pears note (E natural, with which most other tenors take issue), with gently falling figures in the strings underneath. These figures evolve, starting with a few notes trailing down from that E-natural, then growing longer and falling father. Lok at the word \"back\". It's the longest falling pattern written for Peter, almost a note too many, as though the phrase \"turn back\" was caught in his throat and replaced with a sob. What a desperate way to ask a serious question, and what a buzzkill for a pub.\n</p>\n<h4>Exhibit C:<a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428852500698/PeterGrimes4_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DWwSG92gskkKx9bHfRq5t4TuxUGzGSgEqFYXwT9vl1DktASBi9-_aQXSvwDD5-n0O4O9MT7lQ4yvjD5NdxbFbmO7ans\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DWwSG92gskkKx9bHfRq5t4TuxUGzGSgEqFYXwT9vl1DktASBi9-_aQXSvwDD5-n0O4O9MT7lQ4yvjD5NdxbFbmO7ans=s1200\"></a></h4>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"></figure>\n<p>\n\tLet's break away from Peter for a second to look at the significant female characters in <em>Peter Grimes</em>. This is a bit from the stunning quartet sung by Ellen Orford, who loves Peter, Auntie, who owns the town pub, and the two \"nieces\", working for Auntie under questionable job descriptions. This quartet happens just as most of The Borough leaves as an angry mob, headed towards Peter's hut to take judicial matters into their own hands (\"Popular feeling's rising!\"). The women talk about their roles as caregivers in the community; in their lowly status, they ask if they deserve to feel lonely. (\"From the gutter, why should we trouble at their <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ribaldry\" target=\"_blank\">ribaldries</a>?\"). These women contribute to their community in ways that are kept secret, and in public they are forgotten and discarded. The bit of music above shows the refrain to which the ladies keep returning: \"Do we smile or do we weep or wait quietly till they sleep?\" Look at how Britten sets the text for these women. Ellen and Auntie have the top and bottom lines, and although they share a similar rhythm, their melodies diverge. Ellen rises higher and higher, gently and confidently, like a strong woman who has yet to lose her optimism. Auntie starts in her familiar chest voice, her tune slightly angular, and her lower climactic moment sounds like resignation, as if to say, \"this happens every time\". The Nieces share the middle line, slightly out of sync with the two other women. Britten uses this \"wrong rhythm\" to make the girls sound less sure, less steady, and more hurt. These young girls are the most affected by their town's neglect; they share rolling melismas at the end of each refrain, on he word \"till\". The younger you are, the slower time seems to pass.\n</p>\n<h4>Exhibit D:<a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428852538094/PeterGrimes2.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Xgtca_mOPPLMWn4YdwTbTnY8th6P3LurK_q229PWQqtdeVAPngsEVCJYzligtYfWOX0qShu0ISOrkcOI3niuLk9HmwZuw\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Xgtca_mOPPLMWn4YdwTbTnY8th6P3LurK_q229PWQqtdeVAPngsEVCJYzligtYfWOX0qShu0ISOrkcOI3niuLk9HmwZuw=s1200\"></a></h4>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"></figure>\n<p>\n\tWhat's so scary about this mob, anyway? They're just people, right? Peter may be a sensitive guy, but I'll posit that there's nothing scarier than an ill-informed, xenophobic, bored group of small-towners with weapons. For me, the reason for Peter's aloneness is in the above section of music. The whole town is frothing at the mouth over the prospect of arresting Peter for his crimes (which were officially deemed \"accidental circumstances\", but whatever), and they get themselves into such a bloodthirsty tizzy that culminates into hysterical laughter. The music here is absolutely unreal. The din, the <em>noise</em> of it all, finally comes to a point of unison, with everyone onstage singing triumphantly and dangerously and almost freely, under grossly placed laughing syllables, \"Ha! Ha! Ha!\" I just gave myself a shudder. It's one of the moments, both musically and dramatically, that make <em>Peter Grimes</em> a must-see.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn case I've piqued your interest: I know that I should be telling you to listen to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCVNAYikjbE\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Pears' performance of <em>Grimes</em></a>, but I'm not going to. I'm partial to Jon Vickers, because he's a volatile mess of pitiful and dangerous, and his voice...that voice. I entice you with this clip of Vickers' Peter Grimes; it's Peter's mad scene, from the end of the opera. It's written to be part monologue, part anti-overture. Britten brings back plenty of musical mini-themes that we've heard over the whole opera; the effect is the traditional wrapping-up of the story, combined with that operatic staple, the Mad Scene. It's so, <em>so</em> good.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/OWT0jsCbl28\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n</iframe>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>",

        "body": "<h3>1. What's it like to be a Braun?<br>\n</h3>\n<p>\n\tI've always been very proud to be a Braun, and to be my father's daughter. But before I was even aware of what a musical legacy the Brauns really were, my mom and dad split up. I grew up with my mom, luckily still surrounded by music and with great influences such as<a href=\"http://www.musiccentre.ca/node/37210/biography\" target=\"_blank\"> Dr. Derek Holman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lloyd-bradshaw-emc/\" target=\"_blank\">Lloyd Bradshaw</a> in my early years. My mother, Eleanor, had been a part of the U of T Orchestra, playing for the Opera School, and in Banff, when she met my dad, Bill (Richard was his stage name). My mom was in the Hamilton Philharmonic for many years, under <a href=\"http://borisbrott.com/default.html\" target=\"_blank\">Boris Brott</a>, and then became Principal Flute for the Niagara Symphony in 1976. That was the year we moved away from Toronto. The Brauns were far and wide by then, my dad in California, then BC, one aunt in Toronto, one in Texas, another in London, and <a href=\"http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/victor-braun-emc/\" target=\"_blank\">Victor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.music.utoronto.ca/faculty/faculty_members/instructors_s_to_z/Eraine_Schwing-Braun.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Eraine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adibraun.com/#/\" target=\"_blank\">Adi</a>, <a href=\"http://www.russellbraun.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Russell</a> and Torsten were in Europe. I always feel sad that we didn't see each other very much, growing up. Sometimes I feel like the \"cousin from nowhere\". I do have some treasured photos from a few special visits. Now we know each other better, but everyone's always so busy!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI wanted to sing to please my father - and I did - I sent him early recordings and photos, but I didn't pursue it as a profession. He had had the beginnings of a career with the COC, singing many <em>comprimario</em> roles, but his voice wasn't as big as Victor's, and he wouldn't get the big roles, so he left to pursue other things. He didn't push me to pursue music, and neither did my mom...I wish they had.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter high school, I chose interior design and had two children, always finding a way to be involved in a choir or a musical, and quite a few recitals and church solos, but still not truly pursuing it, until now. Kids are grown, and my wonderful husband, Aris, is happy to have me finally following my dreams. I'm certainly in awe of my cousins and so very proud of them, and they have been very supportive of me in my new endeavours!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI hope that I do the Braun name justice, and I'm always sad that my dad isn't here to hear me now, and how I've progressed in the past three years.\n</p>\n<h3>2. Could you talk about the personal connections you've made in the music you perform?</h3>\n<p>\n\tMy choices of music all seem to be sentimental right now, and have been chosen for various reasons. I am lucky first of all, to be working with <a href=\"http://www.akcanada.com/about.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Krochak</a>, a brilliant pianist! Peter and I had crossed paths over 25 years ago when both of us were in St. Catharines, and had the same voice teacher, Mrs. Theresa (Monaghan) Pothier. She had been a student of Maureen Forrester! Peter went on to earn a music degree in piano performance, and also a law degree. A friend reintroduced us in 2013 and we first collaborated doing a fundraiser for the <a href=\"http://www.endcancer.ca/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Weekend to End Women's Cancers</a>. We clicked and have become an inseparable musical duo! For that fundraiser, I had wanted to perform something in Greek, to please my husband's family, as they are from Greece. One of my husband's cousins had just recently been taken by breast cancer. I settled on <a href=\"http://imslp.org/wiki/5_M%C3%A9lodies_populaires_grecques_%28Ravel,_Maurice%29\" target=\"_blank\">Ravel's Five Greek Folksongs</a>, naturally! After the performance, Peter and I decided to <a href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/KiraBraunSoprano\" target=\"_blank\">record a few things</a>, and it just seemed natural to ensure we recorded the Greek songs. They are more often performed in French.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen speaking with my Aunt Irma, who is now in California, she had mentioned that our Opa, Jacob Braun, had always had a passion for Lieder, singing Schubert and Wolf (he even made recordings, I wonder where they went) and she suggested I look at some of that repertoire. I was encouraged by Brahm Goldhamer, my coach, to start working on a few Schubert pieces and when I took them to Peter, we agreed that they would become part of our repertoire together, resulting in five selections that we also recorded. The Mozart \"Exsultate, Jubilate\" has long been a favourite of mine, I've known the notes for many years...but never felt as though I could come close to performing it. I'm happy with our recording and we are talking about a full live performance of this work soon.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor this year, we are already considering recording some Rachmaninoff, Schumann, and Fauré. I've been speaking with Claudia Morawetz too, about choosing some of <a href=\"http://www.oskarmorawetz.com/Tabs/TabHome/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">her father's works</a> to try, along with a couple of other Canadian composers. (We have been friends since 1973, when we were both in the CCOC together!) It seems that art songs and Baroque music are a very good fit for my voice, but I want to be involved in opera too.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428851518086/KiraPeter.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EKYy8VD72Lav4YWdLYp5xox9N3hl56H2mt3i1M6BIJSDIUlkkQRH43GD1yYrUCqEuQ5DWlG8WNGOY1FCbZJXNOXyYxLT\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EKYy8VD72Lav4YWdLYp5xox9N3hl56H2mt3i1M6BIJSDIUlkkQRH43GD1yYrUCqEuQ5DWlG8WNGOY1FCbZJXNOXyYxLT=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Peter Krochack and Kira Braun.

How did your time at the Canadian Children's Opera Company inspire your love of music and performing?</h3>\n<p>\n\tBeing part of the <a href=\"http://www.canadianchildrensopera.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CCOC</a> was the best experience I could have had as a child. It was thrilling, and challenging. We learned choral works that were very mature, musically, and we were taught discipline and choir etiquette! (One did not dare chatter when Dr. Holman was working with another section!) We were polished and prepared, and eager. I think children can more easily learn and absorb new material so our catalogue was long, so to say! We traveled and sang with other choirs too, among them the <a href=\"http://www.tmchoir.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto Mendelssohn Choir</a>, and I distinctly remember a huge Carmina Burana at Massey Hall, when we kids were up in the catwalk, with the adults and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra down below. But the highlight for me was the COC's 1975 production of <em>I Pagliacci</em>. Being on stage in a professional production of that calibre, set my heart ablaze. I have had the passion ever since. And, I've been the consummate chorister in many a fantastic choir, including the <a href=\"http://www.orpheuschoirtoronto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Orpheus Choir</a>, for about five years, learning so much from <a href=\"http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/robert-cooper-emc/\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Cooper</a>, a huge mentor of mine.\n</p>\n<h3>4. As a member of a musical family, how do you make your own mark as an artist?</h3>\n<p>\n\tWell, my cousins have certainly made their mark, and their father before them. I don't know about making a mark, but instead my aim is to continue to learn, to perform with passion, and to share what musical gifts I may have with those who will care to listen. I think I am realistic about my age, and where I am at musically, and I am making and finding opportunities where I think I will best fit. There's a lot of hard work involved, (which is fun for me) and a certain amount of luck too. It certainly doesn't hurt to be a Braun, but I won't get hired simply because of that. I will get hired because of my own effort, and merit. In one year, I have sung the role of Frasquita in a fully staged production with Toronto City Opera, recorded and released two CDs, done a professional recital, and performed my first professional Cantatas with <a href=\"http://www.choraliscamerata.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Choralis Camerata</a> in St. Catharines, singing Britten's <em>Ceremony of Carols</em> and Bach's \"Wachet Auf\", and, landed two opera roles already for 2015, as Oscar with <a href=\"http://operabyrequest.ca/wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">Opera by Request</a> for <em>Un ballo in maschera</em> this February, and as Barbarina with Toronto Summer Opera Workshop in <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> in June!\n</p>\n<h3>5. Why did you choose to record these two albums?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI have always wanted to do a CD, perhaps just to scratch it off my bucket list. Now that I have, I aspire to do more. The process itself was exciting and we sure learned a lot about what it takes to record, tweak, produce, and promote a CD. We chose material that we were both comfortable with, and we hope that our choices as we learn and grow together, will be notable in terms of improvements. There may even be a label in our future! I think 2015 will fly by, with all of the exciting plans and opportunities Peter and I will have. I'm happiest when I'm singing.\n</p>\n<p class=\"intro\">\n\tKira's albums can be downloaded <a href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/KiraBraunSoprano\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>.

        "body": "<p class=\"intro\">\n\tWell, it's been a weird week for critics. After opera critic Paolo Isotta, of the Italian newspaper <em>Corriere della Sera</em>, got himself blacklisted from receiving free media tickets from La Scala, new management has lifted his ban. Although <em>Corriere </em>has since decided to refuse free ticket offers from La Scala in the future, Artistic and music directors Alexander Pereira and Riccardo Chailly have said that <a href=\"http://slippedisc.com/2015/01/exclusive-la-scala-lifts-its-ban-on-newspaper-critic/\" target=\"_blank\">they won't ban any critics</a> from requesting media seats (including Paolo Isotta). How progressive.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAcross the globe, Opera Australia has taken the opposite approach. OA's artistic director Lyndon Terracini removed the names of two critics from his media list, informing them that they were removed specifically because of things they wrote. <a href=\"http://www.stagenoise.com/feature/2015/lyndon-doesnt-like-criticism-who-knew\" target=\"_blank\">Diana Simmonds</a>, of <em>StageNoise</em>, received an email from Opera Australia's media people that stated, \"In response to some of your recent writing about the company, Lyndon asked that you be removed from the media list.\" Jeez. Over at <em>Daily Review</em>, critic Harriett Cunningham got a similar message (<a href=\"http://www.stagenoise.com/feature/2015/and-in-yet-more-breaking-news\" target=\"_blank\">as quoted by Diana Simmonds</a>): \"Hi Harriett - Lyndon is very offended following your article earlier this week - I'm sure this comes as no great surprise. So no, I'm afraid we're not able to offer you any further comp tickets.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, what did they write? Nothing, considering that old, pardoned Paolo Isotta wrote that British conductor Daniel Harding's work with <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> \"was so soft it made you think he wanted to back the unfounded theory that Wagner was homosexual.\" Honestly, Harriett had some harsh words to say about Opera Australia's conservative season programming in her piece, <a href=\"http://dailyreview.crikey.com.au/why-im-not-going-to-the-opera-next-year/16623\" target=\"_blank\">\"Why I'm Not Going to the Opera Next Year\"</a>, and Diana wrote strongly about Lyndon Terracini's professional and artistic methods in her <a href=\"http://www.stagenoise.com/feature/2014/lunatics-not-taking-over-asylum-official\" target=\"_blank\">\"Lunatics Not Taking Over Asylum - Official\"</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEven if these banned critics were objectively wrong about what they wrote, why don't important people like Lyndon Terracini know that censorship will just start another show? I only read the \"offensive\" pieces because I heard about the ban (thanks, Greg Finney!), and now I know that Terracini is tender. Is it just me, or is it <em>really weird</em> that the Italians are opening their doors to haters, and the Australians are shutting them, medieval-style? It must be the full moon. Or people who don't realize that putting caution tape around a problem just makes more people look at the problem.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWrite, on, ladies! Write on.\n</p>",

After opera critic Paolo Isotta, of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, got himself blacklisted from receiving free media tickets from La Scala, new management has lifted his ban. Although Corriere has since decided to refuse free ticket offers from La Scala in the future, Artistic and music directors Alexander Pereira and Riccardo Chailly have said that they won't ban any critics from requesting media seats (including Paolo Isotta). How progressive."

The best feature is that the Brott Music Festival already has a wonderful young professional orchestra, add some hot young singers into the mix and you've got a recipe for some great opera.

        "body": "<h3>1. Why did you start Oshawa Opera?<br>\n</h3>\n<p>\n\tWhy not? Oshawa Opera was born in April 2013, around 1:00 AM during a sleepless night when our daughter Zoé was still not sleeping through the night (she was 3 at the time). As I tried in vain to make her sleep, I thought about what would make me really happy. Oshawa was always known as motor city, my husband and I moved here in 2005 to start our family. At the time, I wondered why we moved here and wondered how a musician could thrive living in an industrial city. Oshawa is growing as a bedroom community to Toronto and as a university city, the community is diverse and the desire for culture is growing. The city of Oshawa has launched a big initiative with <a href=\"http://www.oshawa.ca/culturecounts/\" target=\"_blank\">Culture Counts</a> and I figured, this is the time. This is the time to start building an opera company in Oshawa, not in 10 years, now. Other than the Opera Lyra and Opera York, there are not that many opportunities in Ontario for opera singers to continue to build their craft. Yes, there are several indie companies in Toronto but, not everyone can get to Toronto to hear these singers. A lot of seniors have told me, they used to to go to the COC but, they no longer have the stamina to travel to Toronto so, they are happy they can hear opera in Oshawa and get home in time for dinner!\n</p>\n<h3>2. What are some unique challenges about presenting opera in smaller cities?</h3>\n<p>\n\tWhere do I start? Oshawa Opera is very new; we are in our infancy. Durham Region citizens don't know we exist. They are curious, but they do not know what to expect. I view my role as founder of Oshawa Opera to be an educator. I have to explain everything; explain to sponsors the need for a program, what a concert program entails, and explain that we need volunteers for front of house duties (I have a great team of volunteers!!!!!). Potential audience members tell me \"But, I don't like opera!\" This is where my mommy-training comes in. I say \"Well, have you ever been to the opera?\" Often, the answer is \"No.\" So, I say \"Try it, you might like it. Try it first, and then you can say, you don't like it.\" This is where complimentary tickets can go a long way. Yes, we lose money but, we gain an educated audience member that can now make an educated choice. Finding an ideal venue for Oshawa Opera has been a challenge. The newly renovated Regent Theatre (where the symphony performs) is beautiful, but costly to rent and there is no piano. Hence, we are grateful for the support of <a href=\"http://kingsviewunitedchurch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kingsview United Church</a>. The space is beautiful and open, and it houses a great grand piano. One day, we will have our own orchestra, mark my words! Our chorus is small, but mighty! I get a lot of enquiries from singers but, again, they are scared to sing in a different language or terrified to sing high notes. Again, I teach them that high notes (and low notes) are fun; and again, unless you try it, you can't assume you \"can't sing in Italian!\".\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428809663945/Screen-Shot-2015-01-08-at-3.53.49-PM.png\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WKHqFpoYl8yNkgtF-lMwEqkeS101jOT5IBZ294uW0hqAouleYFlW8ruuHAyuUJCuYCknSNhx7NMTPhEhu06aZqNc05KV\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WKHqFpoYl8yNkgtF-lMwEqkeS101jOT5IBZ294uW0hqAouleYFlW8ruuHAyuUJCuYCknSNhx7NMTPhEhu06aZqNc05KV=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Michael Robert-Broder (Escamillo) and Sarah Steinert (Carmen) in Oshawa Opera's <em>Carmen</em>.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>3. What kind of reception has Oshawa Opera gotten from its first season?</h3>\n<p>\n\tExciting! We had to move from our first venue, because it was too small! Audience members have said \"Who knew we had talent in this town!\" We have made it our mission that children can attend our performances for free. This is how we are going to build tomorrow's audience. All the children that have attended our performances have enjoyed the concerts and were quiet during the performances. Some children have said \"It's too loud!\" or \"That character is funny!\" or \"I want to sing for you, when I am big!\". This all makes the countless hours worth it.\n</p>\n<h3>4. What repertoire do you hope to explore in future seasons?</h3>\n<p>\n\tWe want to continue to produce the well known operas in shorter versions and adaptations. I am hoping to share next season in April 2015. Italian Opera will always be a staple of our season.I am hoping to stage at least one production next year and I will continue to produce at least one concert in English. Understanding the sung words, for our audience, is crucial. So, without naming any specific titles, lets say, there will be Verdi in Oshawa next year, for sure!\n</p>\n<h3>5. Why are companies like Oshawa Opera important for the industry as a whole?</h3>\n<p>\n\tAgain, to educate the public. The idea that the public does not know what it wants is false. We need to perform quality music for them to want more. That is what we need to do. I have had several audience members tell me \"Oh, now I want to go to the COC and hear another opera!\" Isn't that what it is all about ? Sharing the love of opera. I had a child tell me, recently, \"I can't wait to be old enough to go to the opera ALONE. I don't want to come with my parents, I want to go by myself!\" I know my job is done!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor details about upcoming performances from Oshawa Opera, <a href=\"http://www.theoshawaopera.com/\" target=\"_blank\">visit their new website here</a>.\n</p>",

        "body": "<p class=\"intro\">\n\tLast night I went to see famed mezzo-soprano <a href=\"http://www.annesofievonotter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anne Sofie von Otter</a> and star pianist <a href=\"http://www.angelahewitt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Angela Hewitt</a> in recital. I couldn't believe my luck; these two women are both artists whom I've wanted to hear live for years, and here they both were at the very convenient Koerner Hall. They performed a focused, cohesive program. The first half was (mostly) all German, featuring Lieder by Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms, and French repertoire (Hahn, Chabrier, and Fauré) took up the second half, including one of my own personal favourites, Debussy's <em>Trois chansons de Bilitis</em>. Hewitt showed off her solo chops, too, with piano music by Schubert, Brahms and Chabrier.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnne Sofie sang in a easy, bright voice, and she always made sure the voice was a vehicle for the text. The first half, I thought, was full of music that progressively suited her voice more and more. Beethoven songs aren't my favourite, and Anne Sofie made a point of mentioning that old Ludwig isn't the greatest writer for the voice. But I loved what the one Italian-language song (\"In questa tomba oscura\") did for her sound; there was more line in the song anyway, but something about the brighter language gave me my first chance to really hear Anne Sofie's voice. Her Schubert was sensitive but not too precious (I really dislike wimpy Schubert). It was in the Brahms Lieder that I loved her most. She showed off a textbook legato in these songs, not letting a note go by un-sung. And she still sounds young! I love when you can hear technical evidence of a singer who's been smart for decades.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSurprisingly, I liked her French half the best. Again, the brighter language gave her lots of ring, and she seemed more willing to fill out the top of her voice. She and Angela gave one of the more beautiful readings of <em>Trois chansons de Bilitis</em> that I've ever heard. Speaking of Angela, she was a great collaborator, with a healthy mix of leading and listening. She brought out aspects of these songs, some of which I know well, that I'd never heard or paid attention to before. It sounds like an odd thing to say, but Angela's left hand was spectacular. She made sense of the Beethoven Lieder this way, and found the trick to all those odd Brahms phrases. In the French repertoire, her sound was what I'd always strived for when I took on pieces like Fauré's <em>Clair de lune</em>. She had a specific sound to each song that was noticeable, and she didn't shy away from playing with guts. I thought she covered Anne Sofie a few times, but I forgave her easily. Angela rocked out on her last solo piece, Chabrier's Idylle, which sounded like Beethoven if he were Poulenc, and got wide-armed applause from Anne Sofie herself.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428809512628/Hewitt_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZBGHFGoienyyC0Dr9GBuYcLykgi9DCLLANuJWQjnmpp-yRSjuxGxoX5t-t8B7U4Kle4_USheNsxJ8-m15mcLpzPYsTI\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZBGHFGoienyyC0Dr9GBuYcLykgi9DCLLANuJWQjnmpp-yRSjuxGxoX5t-t8B7U4Kle4_USheNsxJ8-m15mcLpzPYsTI=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Pianist Angela Hewitt. Photo: Maiwolf</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tThe repertoire for this concert was, for my own taste, a bit conservative. I kind of wanted to hear what Anne Sofie would sound like in some Kurt Weill cabaret songs, or something really weird. But these two women did what they do best, and it was obvious that they both loved every song they performed. Conservative as it may have been, Angela and Anne Sofie had fun. Angela seemed to act out stories with her hands, and Anne Sofie did a little jig to a song's peppy postlude more than once. A recital like this is a testament to the women's skill. Angela showed that her playing is about the music, not about putting herself at the forefront; Anne Sofie reminded us all that she's got more tricks up her sleeve than being an Octavian-extraordinaire.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI sat beside Michael Vincent (of <a href=\"http://www.musicaltoronto.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Musical Toronto</a>) for the concert, and he mentioned to me that Anne Sofie von Otter and Angela Hewitt had been trying to co-ordinate a concert together for several years. I hope they do it again soon.\n</p>",

        "body": "<h3>1. Manon<br>\n</h3>\n<p>\n\tOddly, thinking of Manon at an opera was what got me on the topic to begin with. I figure that Manon would want to see something that glamourizes life and life's difficult decisions. She'd probably <em>just die</em> for the chance to see <em>Tosca</em>; Manon would find fabulous common ground with the fellow diva who fights for her man. I bet Manon would love herself a good <em>La traviata</em>, too; her <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sz2mpzYjcI\" target=\"_blank\">Gavotte</a> is a fair comparison to Violetta's \"Sempre libera\", after all. Oh, and Berg's <em>Lulu</em>.\n</p>\n<h3>2. Papageno</h3>\n<p>\n\tHow cute would he be, flitting around from usher to usher, trying to find his seat? He'd probably jump at tickets for <em>Hänsel und Gretel</em>, what with all the food and magic (hopefully we caught the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMuEwhw97RI\" target=\"_blank\">Met's 2008 production</a> with the tongue-house and the big-headed chefs!). If he's feeling melancholy, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flVBOlBg_tg\" target=\"_blank\">which sometimes happens</a>, I bet Papageno would love <em>Rusalka</em>; he'd empathize with her non-human status and her quest for true love. I picture him drying his eyes with his feathers.\n</p>\n<h3>3. Suzuki</h3>\n<p>\n\tWise, loving, and probably charmingly conservative, Suzuki would probably only treat herself to one opera a year. I bet it would be <em>Dialogues des Carmélites</em>. Sounds weird, but if anyone understands faith, hope, and honour, <a href=\"/talking-with-singers-elizabeth-deshong/\" target=\"_blank\">it would be Suzuki</a>. I think she'd find something to love about most of the women in the opera, save for Sister Blanche (Suzuki and I have that in common). Although <em>Dialogues</em> doesn't offer up a happy ending that someone like Suzuki might crave, at least there are some rationally thinking women involved. Sorry, Cio-Cio San.\n</p>\n<h3>4. Werther</h3>\n<p>\n\tEasy. He'd be curled up in a partially obstructed seat for <em>Eugene Onegin</em>, where he could wrestle with the idea that Onegin's torment just may be greater than his own. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFgMowOwek0\" target=\"_blank\">Sondheim, anyone?</a>) For catharsis, there's always <em>Otello </em>or <em>Peter Grimes</em> to remind Werther he shouldn't trust anyone ever. I want to say that, on his good days, Werther would go and see <em>La bohème</em>, because of the poet factor, but I'm sure it would send him into a spiral of despair that can't even be described by the most compound of German words.\n</p>\n<h3>5. Don Giovanni</h3>\n<p>\n\t<em>Don Giovanni</em>, natch. Sociopathic narcissist, anyone? Maybe <em>Falstaff</em> for a laugh, because Giovanni could still dream of growing up to be Sir John.\n</p>",

A \"new\" class of young, urban man who's upped his masculinity factor by wearing plaid and not shaving. I put <i>new</i> in quotation marks because I know of a good many young man here in Toronto from all areas of the sexuality spectrum rocking this look for quite some time now and I say \"not shaving\" instead of \"sporting a beard\" because the two are very, <i>very</i>, different. Sporting a beard requires a heckuva lot of grooming - probably more meticulous grooming than our clean-shaven counterparts. The trimming of the moustache so it stays out of your coffee cup/soup spoon/beer stein, the cleaning of neck hair so it doesn't get caught and pulled out in the weaves of your oxford shirt collar, the shampooing and conditioning (yes, one should do this to their beard - it's hair, after all) and then of course any of the other accoutrements - beard oil, sideburn matching, combing and brushing. These are all parts of responsible beard ownership.<br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">This post isn't so much about singing or opera or theatre in the usual sense. I just wanted to talk about one of the parts of our industry that sort of gets taken for granted by the audience. I make that statement because I'm guilty of it. I also opened with that little bit of a diatribe so that I can hope make a point stronger. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">In the entertainment industry (yes, opera is a part of that, if you weren't aware; surprise, people come to be entertained!) there is enormous pressure regarding looks and physical prowess/appearance. We all remember <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQqPauyGiVU\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Dress\" fiasco around Deborah Voigt</a> and there's a serious call to rally against the <a href=\"/when-critics-are-jerks/\" target=\"_blank\">\"fat-shaming\" of the business</a>. My views on that are mixed and complicated like many others in the industry. It's a piece/study/thesis all on its own (I'm working on that alongside my \"Why I don't Love <em>Madama Butterfly</em>\" piece). </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">I just want to touch on the fact that even though sometimes people go through drastic physical changes for their art (Christan Bale, anyone? No? Okay he's mine then #dibs), oftentimes it's small changes that are done to assist the audience along with their suspension of disbelief. Wigs, makeup, costumes, and - in some extreme circumstances - prosthetics are all employed to bring the fantastical world of opera to life. </span>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428809224950/GregBeard2.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PNQoRqLBhOiXHF1Qqq6BgPYACcwzqgq47EOM_yDqIF9DvIban8oG7uefjkwcpwupRzkdRPU94D1S7AlaNXV_gCLwZ3q_\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PNQoRqLBhOiXHF1Qqq6BgPYACcwzqgq47EOM_yDqIF9DvIban8oG7uefjkwcpwupRzkdRPU94D1S7AlaNXV_gCLwZ3q_=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Greg as Figaro in Milhaud's <em>La mère coupable</em>, 2012. Photo: Emily Ding</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">One sacrifice that is often made in the name of \"Period Exactitude\" is that of a man's facial hair. For some of us, it's a part of our brand. It's our face, it's what we look like. I'm widely known among my colleagues and peers for my \"glorious ginger beard\" (these, simultaneously, are and are not my own words), it's a good half of the real estate of my face and it's an integral part of my physical identity and self image. Recently, as is often the case, I was asked to shave for a role. #facepalm. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">I wear a beard all day, every day, all-year long and this company (as well as others) know me both personally and professionally and I'm not a stranger to their ranks. Just once, I'd like to hear \"We needed a guy with a beard, so naturally we thought of you\" instead of hearing \"You're great, but the beard doesn't work for us\". So, what you're saying is, in essence, that my face doesn't work for you, which is fine; remember how we established that this is the entertainment industry? Great, we're still on the same page. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">So why force me to live for a good 3 months with a strangers face on the top of my neck? \"Three months!\" \"Egad!! \"He can't be serious!!!\" Guys, calm down, I can hear you from here. As I type this, my whiskers are coming back - albeit slowly at first - and I'll have a proper beard-shape in another week (I put my razor down about 1.5 weeks ago). There we go - over half a month into the regrowth and it's still just scruff on my face. By the time it reaches its proper length, and it's gone through the proper grooming (so it doesn't just turn into hair on my face), the conditioning, shaping, daily trims, all the ritual I love about having this fine, natural, beautiful accessory, it will probably be after Easter-tide before I see 'Big Red' as I'm used to having him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">But is this a worthwhile issue to have? Maybe not.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">Is it my overprotective ego that's used to being told (as all opera singers are) that everything I'm doing is incorrect jumping into high gear for no reason? Most likely. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">When I sit down and look at it objectively, I'm actually pretty lucky. I'm in my early thirties and can grow a full beard. Full stop. No patchiness, no weird curly flyaways, I don't have to grow out a nasty mess of neck hair to provide the illusion of beardliness. Yet, I have the remarkable luck of being able to shave it off and looking like AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSON. I've had dear friends of close to a decade, pass me on the street after a fresh shave and literally not recognize me - even though I have a very distinct style of dressing and moving through a crowd and they just saw me the day before. As a performer, I DO actually take pride in this very special skill - and there's a lot of fun in the regrowing of a beard. Especially when you have the luxury of meeting a new friend with your clean cheeks, and then they get to witness your #transginger* glory develop in real time like super cool time-lapse video from National Geographic. </span>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428809282274/GregBeard4.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U3P62sYtF2xk7etOdWkcRNt-7enNYart_-1HCoObGXRn5LIU_fCXaWBTZQwgXrz0d3F1FsyozJTfO6SQh0ZWIfqrZ1nJUQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U3P62sYtF2xk7etOdWkcRNt-7enNYart_-1HCoObGXRn5LIU_fCXaWBTZQwgXrz0d3F1FsyozJTfO6SQh0ZWIfqrZ1nJUQ=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Greg as Alcindoro in Against the Grain Theatre's <em>La bohème</em>, 2011. Photo: Gene Wu</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">So long story short, I understand that someone asking me to shave is not quite the same as Renée Zellweger's weight gain for <i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i>, Christian Bale's weight loss for <i>The Machinist</i> or Chris Pratt's (correction: #dibsonthisguy) complete transformation, it's still a very personal one. Think of your bearded friends and how much they love their beards, and then imagine what they must feel like when asked to remove it. I get it, it's a small sacrifice on my part - grand scheme-wise - but it's <i>important to me</i>... and my face. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<span class=\"s1\">Also, <i>please </i>be careful of the way you \"compliment\" a newly-shorn beardy. When you say \"You look so much better like this!\", we hear \"You look awful every other time I've seen you\".

Canadian fave Russell Braun will bring back a signature Mozart role as the Count, and Austrian bass-baritone <a href=\"http://www.artistsman.com/home/kuenstler_verzeichnis/baritonbass/josef-wagner/\" target=\"_blank\">Josef Wagner</a> sings Figaro.

It's one of his serious works, and rarely done, because the title role is apparently ridiculous to sing. But Italian bass-baritone <a href=\"http://www.lucapisaroni.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Luca Pisaroni</a> is up for the challenge, singing in the David Alden production of <em>Maometto II</em>. <a href=\"http://www.elizabethdeshong.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth DeShong</a> returns to the COC as Calbo (I can't wait to see her in a pants role!), and soprano <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leahcrocetto\" target=\"_blank\">Leah Crocetto</a> debuts as Anna. Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/conductors/harry-bicket\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Bicket</a> conducts.

You've heard of Rufus Wainwright and Daniel MacIvor's upcoming <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/Hadrian.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Hadrian</i></a>, set to open the 2018/19 season, and now we can look forward to <em>La Reine-Garçon</em>, the new opera by <a href=\"http://www.anasokolovic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ana Sokolović</a> and <a href=\"http://www.michelmarcbouchard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michel Marc Bouchard</a> in 2019/20. On top of that, Russell Braun will star in the title role of Harry Somers' <a href=\"http://www.harrysomers.com/page5/page5.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Louis Riel</em></a> in 2017. A Canadian opera company indeed!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, there you have it! I think it's a neat mix of traditional and new, and it's definitely a <em>great</em> season for young Canadian singers.

        "body": "<p>\n\tThis past weekend, I attended The Opera Exchange, an event presented semi-regularly by the Canadian Opera Company to discuss relevant opera topics, structured around the COC's current season. With Dmitri Tcherniakov's production of <em>Don Giovanni</em> set to open on January 24th at the Four Seasons Centre, it was a good opportunity to chat about that polarizing topic, <em>Regietheater</em>, or director's theatre.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMichael and Linda Hutcheon, a married couple of professors, opened the event with a short lecture on where the idea of <em>Regietheater</em> comes from. Turns out, the answer is Germany. Michael and Linda spoke about the Wagner productions in Bayreuth that kicked off opera's reign of the director, like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/Tannh%C3%A4user-2-DVDs-Hans-Sotin/dp/B001A5REB2\" target=\"_blank\">Götz Friedrich's 1972 <em>Tannhäuser</em></a>, and<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wagner-Nibelungen-Bayreuth-Festival-Complete/dp/B00005OATQ\" target=\"_blank\"> Patrice Chéreau's centennial production</a> of <em>Der Ring des Nibelungen</em> in 1976. The productions were passionately rejected by audiences, but within a few seasons, the novelty was (mostly) forgiven, and Friedrich and Chéreau were considered trailblazers for opera and theatre directors. The question of whether or not <em>Regietheater </em>is good or bad for the art form was left to a panel of pros.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe panel included Ashlie Corcoran (Artistic Director, Thousand Islands Playhouse), Joel Ivany (Artistic Director, Against the Grain Theatre), Lawrence Wiliford (tenor), William Germano (Cooper Union), Nina Penner (McGill University), and Wayne Gooding (editor,<em> Opera Canada</em>). There was a fair amount of consensus that a creative director is what opera wants. Ashlie Corcoran is all about storytelling, and she insisted that the story comes from not only the libretto, but within the notes of the score. I've worked with Ashlie before, and I can attest to her using her ears as well as her eyes when she directs. Joel Ivany considered the issue more about removing barriers between the piece and the audience; his own experience in writing new libretti for the three Mozart/DaPonte operas is a successful example of that. (I asked Joel if he considered his original librettos for <em>Figaro</em>, <em>Giovanni</em> and <em>Così</em> to be <em>Regietheater</em>: \"I don't, but other people would. What I do is very traditional to the story, it's just a new story.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Opera Canada</em> editor Wayne Gooding posed the problem of <em>Regietheater</em>'s slippery slope. \"How far are we willing to let them create before we say, 'no, you can't do that'?\" The COC's <a href=\"http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/02/04/opera-review-at-least-the-music-rocks-at-this-masked-ball/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Un ballo in maschera</em></a> (by Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito) from last season was Wayne's example of a production that had started with a concept, and finished with thee characters left \"stranded\". Speaking for singers was Canadian tenor Lawrence Wiliford, who made the important point that a director owes to his cast and creative team a certain level of preparation and understanding of the piece. Since it's singers, not directors, that must step onstage each night to carry out the director's vision, a director must have a clear reason for their concept; if a singer can't relate a director's idea to his or her character, it's the job of the director to connect the dots.\"Ideally, I enjoy the work that I do most in opera when there is a collaborative perspective on whatever work it is,\" says Lawrence.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere were a few questions from the audience, like about how a director considers (or doesn't consider) the audience's acoustic experience during a show, or about a director's basic knowledge of the musical score (including a disturbing anecdote of a director working strictly from a libretto, no score in sight).\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428806338711/VegasRigoletto.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CehLgA1PneD8a9C4fSZ4lk9_mfA387za_EOIH9HyXVjcq958XIYBRMw7rM0Pdn-Do9Dn53EBoSv_AK_KjQHo6acYIan\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CehLgA1PneD8a9C4fSZ4lk9_mfA387za_EOIH9HyXVjcq958XIYBRMw7rM0Pdn-Do9Dn53EBoSv_AK_KjQHo6acYIan=s1200\"></a><figcaption>The Metropolitan Opera's <em>Rigoletto</em>, directed by Michael Mayer</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tI couldn't help circling back to my own big question, which is: how did this happen? Is the repertoire so lacking in dramatic clarity that the director must act as translator? Why is it such a big deal for a director to take charge of live theatre, and why is it such a risk to the art form? <em>Regietheater</em> only means that the director is in charge; for good reason, the term has become synonymous with \"concept productions\" and \"weird staging\". Let's clear up the problem: it's when directors superimpose a concept on a show that doesn't warrant it. \"There's that fine line, and you don't know where it is,\" says director Joel Ivany, bringing up the old chestnut of the 2005 <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/76305d3c-8609-11d9-b506-00000e2511c8.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rigoletto</em> à-la-<em>Planet of the Apes</em> in Munich</a>. \"Was there a lot of in-depth preparation or do you just put everyone in gorilla suits?\" That's the real point of the <em>Regietheater</em> debate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I ask \"how did this happen?\" I don't mean to join the haters of <em>Regietheater</em>. The following quote from <em><a href=\"http://www.earlymusicworld.com/id44.html\" target=\"_blank\">Early Music World</a> </em>was used by Michael and Linda Hutcheon when delineating the poles of the debate: \"Opera is sick. Very sick. Once handsome and noble, its formerly elegant features have over recent years become ever more contorted and distorted beneath a toxic, suppurating excrescence commonly known as <em>Regietheater</em>.\" I don't agree with this. People are too tender about new things, especially people who love opera. They can be tender all they want (like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=815481098518718&amp;id=146292958770872\" target=\"_blank\">this Facebook page</a>, wow), because the real question is whether or not these reigning directors are showing us the piece or showing us their personal brand.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI have a huge problem with directors imposing their personal styles onto an opera before deciding that they want to direct said opera. The problem, at least for directors of opera and other forms of live theatre, is that they have the <em>option</em> of reigning supreme. In the case of most \"great\" opera into which the director wants to sink his teeth, the composer and libretto are both dead. Since the minds that created the source material aren't available for consultation (or to shut down bad ideas), perhaps it was only a matter of time before directors wanted to add their names to the credits of an opera.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjvHW5P_QKvDSf_0wHgTHrQFw39_Q13FC\" target=\"_blank\">At its worst</a>, <em>Regietheater</em> is simply a director who puts his own stamp on an opera, regardless of the congruence between his concept and the piece itself. At its best, <em>Regietheater</em> is a director who clears away preconceptions about what an opera should look like, and presenting the piece in the world they've imagined after looking with clean eyes at the music and text. I'd even cede that there is bad <em>Regietheater </em>created with good intentions; but that's like arguing that you shouldn't fire your Violetta because she doesn't have the technique to make it through the role.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI'm not a fan of slippery-slope arguments, probably because they're poorly used to keep the LGBT community from getting married and other ridiculous fights. When it comes to <em>Regietheater</em>, the only slippery slope to fear is that of the composer's ignorance of the piece itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe director's first job is to make sure that the entire rehearsal room is trying to tell the same story. It strikes me that this isn't difficult to do for the director who knows the answer. Albert Einstein is credited with saying, \"If you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you don't understand it yourself.\" (Clarity: I'm making <em>no suggestions</em> that a singer's intelligence is equivalent to that of a six-year-old.) I'm just saying that if a director has a story to tell, that's a great start. If a director simply has an idea of \"things that are neat to see onstage\", I want them to get away from my opera.\n</p>\n<p class=\"intro\">\n\tI digress!

        "body": "<h3>1. What's it like to return to a role like Pamina, which you say originally put you \"on the map\"?<br>\n</h3>\n<p>\n\tIt's like putting on an old pair of jeans and remembering why they were always your favourite. Pamina is the role that I made my European debut with at the Vienna Volksoper and was brought back to sing many times. She has grown with me over the years and every time I pick her up, I fall in love with something new. Singing her right now I feel my voice is finally up to *all* the challenges she offers... I never felt I was able to sing her suicide scene (with the three spirits) with the depth that I always felt it needed and now finally feel like I have the technical control and depth to be able to finesse that scene like I've always dreamed I could. What can I say, my voice just looooves to sing Mozart. Plus, now I understand the German!\n</p>\n<h3>2. What does Pamina represent in the story of <em>The Magic Flute</em>?</h3>\n<p>\n\tPamina is the epitome of truth, strength, faith, goodness, and light. She has been told lies her whole life by her mother, the Queen of the Night, and within the telling of this story she goes on a life journey to discover that even if it seems everyone is against you, and nobody will listen to reason, love and faith can bring you the inner strength to overcome even the greatest hurdles. In this story she hits her darkest moments (she attempts suicide), but it is her love for Tamino and discovering he loves her in return which brings her faith back and makes her stronger than ever!\n</p>\n<h3>3. What do you look forward to about performing in Canada again?</h3>\n<p>\n\tIt is *so* good to be back in Canada. I have spent most of my career performing all over Europe, and while I do love it, there is still that extra comfort being in the country where you grew up, studied, and where your family is on the same (or much closer) time zone. Also, while my German is quite good these days, my Portuguese, Slovenian, Swedish, etc., are still really lacking. There is nothing like the comfort that comes with being able to converse in your native language, and have similar experiences to those on the team (we know the same commercials, movie quotes, etc). This <em>Magic Flute</em> cast is extra special since it is like a reunion of sorts. I sang my first named role in an opera (ever!) with Adam Luther (Tamino) in an <em>opera buffa</em> performance of <em>Gianni Schicchi</em> back when we were in our early university years. Even Bertrand Malo (Speaker &amp; Priest) and I studied our bachelors degrees at McGill at the same time. Add to that the ability to shop at Shoppers Drug Mart after rehearsal, before having dinner at Swiss Chalet, and you have one happy diva.\n</p>\n<h3>4. There's an idea in Canada, that Canadian opera singers need to work abroad first, before they can build a real career at home. Is there any truth to that?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI know many singers who have built great careers and stayed in North America. I also know many singers who have crossed the ocean to start their careers, and wound up staying in Europe. The Atlantic feels like the great divide, and sometimes I wonder if anybody really knows that things happen on both sides of it, simultaneously *gasp*. That being said, I think the idea comes from the fact that there are so many more opportunities to perform on the opera stage in Europe, particularly in Germany and Austria. Opera houses there usually have a different production every night of the week, and employ singers as full-time staff (civil servants, in fact). It's a very different kind of pressure, and one which definitely pushes you to your limits. What most impresses me is when people have made solid careers on both sides of the Atlantic, and farther.\n</p>\n<h3>5. Why do you think <em>The Magic Flute</em> is so popular?</h3>\n<p>\n\tBecause the music is simply DIVINE! Add to that larger-than-life characters mixed with relatable human emotions, and of course a bit of magic thrown in here and there. What's not to like?!\n</p>\n<p class=\"intro\">\n\tFor more from Jessica, follow her on Twitter, at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessicamuirhead\" target=\"_blank\">@JessicaMuirhead</a>, and find details about <i>The Magic Flute</i> <a href=\"http://www.edmontonopera.com/season/2014-15/magic-flute\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>.

Both [Tapestry Opera and the Canadian Art Song Project]&nbsp;are trying to give both our artists and their respective art forms a new voice. Saying, what does it mean to create opera in the 21st century? How do we make it relatable to our current audiences?

Says Philcox,&nbsp;\"it's repertoire that's going to let each of these artists shine.\" That he's a fantastic pianist and collaborator is common knowledge among Canadian opera-ites; Steven Philcox is also a passionate educator.&nbsp;\"The performing is always fun, but it's the teaching that I'm looking forward to the most, and kind of getting inside this music with the young artists, and helping them find their own truths through it.\"</p><p>In my own experience with Tapestry shows, the collection of short scenes and excerpts is an amazing way to get a taste of what Canadians are writing and what kind of stories they're telling. \"When you think about Canada as a nation, we're known for being self-effacing,\" says Philcox. \"I think that because of that there are so many influences that are coming into Canadian music that it's, you know, a kind of cornucopia of sound. Each composer might have his own language and a certain style that definitely becomes recognizable. But to say that there's an overall Canadian sound, I don't think you can actually say that, but that's what makes Canadian music so wonderful.\"</p><p><em>Songbook V</em>&nbsp;happens at 8pm this Saturday, January 24th, at the Ernest Balmer Studio in the Distillery District. <a href=\"https://tapestryopera.com/SongbookV\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for details and tickets</a>.</p>",

        "body": "<p>At lunchtime on Thursday, January 22nd, members of the COC Ensemble Studio gave a <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/FreeConcertSeries.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">concert in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre</a>. Just past the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the music on this concert dealt with themes of war, love, and separation; we heard songs by Erich Korngold, Charles Ives, Hanns Eisler, and Francis Poulenc. It was a great, beautiful recital that featured fantastic pairings of singers and songs.</p><p>Baritone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clarencefrazer\" target=\"_blank\">Clarence Frazer</a> sang most of the German rep, starting with Korngold's&nbsp;<em>Fünf Lieder</em>, Op. 38. Clarence is sounding great, especially in this rep. It's not been long since I heard Clarence sing, and I thought he sounded noticeably&nbsp;different. He sang with a clarity and a freedom that allowed him to really enjoy the German poetry. I thought the style of the songs, all gorgeous and film-score-like, suited Clarence perfectly. It was the most present and open sound I've heard from him, and I loved it. &nbsp;Two of the Korngold songs have English texts, including a setting of Shakespeare's \"My Mistress' Eyes\"; honestly, Clarence, you slayed me a bit with this one. Bravo.</p><p>Bass-baritone<a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/NewToOpera/OnlineLearningCentre/ParlandoTheCOCBlog.aspx?EntryID=25769\" target=\"_blank\"> Iain MacNeil</a> was the perfect fit for Ives'&nbsp;<em>Three Songs of War</em>. He spoke about the songs before singing, and it was clear that he had respect for the poems, and for the stories of the songs' creators. It showed in his singing, using his focused sound to&nbsp;spend lots of energy on delivering text. I wondered if he almost took the songs too seriously; those songs are a surprisingly big sing, and I thought he could have gotten away with less voice and a more speech-like approach. He did show a beautiful range in colour, from thrilling full voice to sudden <i>pianissimo</i>. Attention to detail: I like it.</p><p>Iain and Clarence shared the singing of nine songs from Hanns Eisler's <em>Das Hollywooder Liederbuch</em>,&nbsp;most of which were set to texts by Bertolt Brecht. The songs are completely cool, some of them miniature. Clarence soared over the melodrama in these songs, and Iain again was totally connected to the poetry. Awesome choice for these two singers.</p><p>Then, the tenors showed up. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jfortierlazure\" target=\"_blank\">Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure</a> sang a perfect,&nbsp;<em>perfect</em>&nbsp;delivery of Poulenc's&nbsp;<em>Deux poèmes de Louis Aragon</em>. This pair of songs is so immediate in message, so unashamed to talk about the squalor of war, that it always floors me with its beauty. Jean-Philippe risked so much in&nbsp;<em>C</em>; he got angry, he got sad, he hung that beautiful note on \"délaissé---e\". It was&nbsp;<em>so beautiful</em>.&nbsp;\"Fêtes galantes\" was wicked. Jean-Philippe had an obvious advantage with all that French set at warp speed, but there was so much detail in every single line of that ugly poem that it was mesmerizing. And then he sang&nbsp;<em>Bleuet</em> and I just died. That song, plus Jean-Philippe's commitment to it, was the total package.</p><p>Finally, tenor<a href=\"http://www.andrewhaji.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Andrew Haji</a> closed the concert with \"What passing bells\", from Benjamin Britten's&nbsp;<em>War Requiem</em>. He spoke beautifully about the piece&nbsp;before he sang, and set up the gravity of the message. Andrew's voice seems perfectly suited to so many different styles, it's fascinating; of course, the Britten-tenor style is no exception. He had great ring in his sound, and brought to life&nbsp;all the details in the score, letting them serve the words. It was a wonderful finish to the program.</p><p>A big nod goes to pianist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/szetojenn\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Szeto</a>, who played the entire concert. It was a dense program with a huge stylistic span, and she was appropriately chameleon-like with every new set of songs. I especially liked her understated, feathery Poulenc. There's a certain sound that pianists seek in French rep, and I liked Jennifer's version of it.

The scenes from <em>Lo sposo deluso,</em> or <em>The Disappointed Bridegroom</em>, were the only finished sections of the abandoned opera. The opera felt like a mix of <em>La serva padrona</em> and <em>Don Pasquale</em>, with a blustering baritone who buys himself a bride, and a few overlapping love triangles between his intended bride, his marriage broker and his niece.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tGordon Bintner was spectacular as Bocconio, the groom-to-be. He sang with enormous energy, despite how unforgivingly high the role seemed. He seemed an expert on switching up between his cannon of a full voice to funny patter that imitated a plucked double bass. As the unwilling bride-to-be, Eugenia, Julie Boulianne showed a beautifully rich and warm sound, negotiating huge leaps and clear-as-a-bell coloratura. Her aria sounded to me like a combo of Fiordiligi and Konstanze; very cool, didn't sound easy to sing.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tTenor John Tessier sang Don Asdrubale's aria, in which he sells the sham marriage as something to be desired. Tessier sang it well with a that reedy, open sound you want in Don Ottavio and Tamino. I had expected a bit more Dr. Malatesta in this aria, but I don't know the score or text, beyond the translations provided. The final ensemble number brought in soprano Hélène Guilmette and Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure, and it was fascinating to hear a precursor of the Act II <i>Figaro </i>finale.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428806466528/Screen-Shot-2015-01-23-at-3.46.16-PM.png\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZDIl9pDYPd8nhBCCy6jpgVS9qFduslnNAUAXkJA5sF5-ewTOWFSHLB1SaqauGmJlS22-wQIjtACS6CErQeOJQeT96ml\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZDIl9pDYPd8nhBCCy6jpgVS9qFduslnNAUAXkJA5sF5-ewTOWFSHLB1SaqauGmJlS22-wQIjtACS6CErQeOJQeT96ml=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Hélène Guilmette, Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure, Paul Goodwin, Gordon Bintner, John Tessier. Photo: Malcolm Cook</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tThe <em>Zaide </em>excerpts were lovely to hear. I admit to only being really familiar with Zaide's aria, \"Ruhe sanft\", which is still a popular choice for sopranos. But it's so beautiful, this music. John Tessier sang Gomatz's aria, which had real suggestions of Belmonte from <em>Die Entführung</em> and Tito's arias in <em>La clemenza di Tito</em>. Hélène Guilmette sang Zaide with agility and lightness, and I was dying to hear more. The final trio included Gordon Bintner, as Allazin, who again sounded <em>fantastic</em>. The writing of the trio was similar to the ensembles in <i>Die Zauberflöte</i>, once again piquing the nerdier side of me.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tIt was amazing to hear these unfinished pieces of Mozart's work. The Mozartness is always there, with beautifully symmetrical phrases and transparent lines; but I noticed a few awkward endings, too-thick orchestration, and lines for the singers that weren't <em>quite </em>organic to the language (or the limits of human lung capacity). This is one of those concerts I wish I could hear with new ears, so I weren't always inclined to compare new Mozart (for me) to familiar Mozart.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tThe second half of the concert featured the sections of the Mass in C Minor that were completed by Mozart himself. The Mass was where the women stood out, I thought. Julie Boulianne sang the well-known \"Laudamus te\", with such stillness it was thrilling. It's a difficult sing, and Julie had already showed us that \"mezzo-soprano\" is simply a word, with her enormous and easy range. It was a wonderful thing to see a singer so calm and grounded, delivering clean and exciting singing. She also didn't bring her music up with her for this aria; performance practice (and perceived blasphemy) aside, it added to the show of it all. Gorgeous dress, too. Hélène Guilmette did most of her work in the Mass, sounding bell-like and florid in her aria, including an extended and exposed cadenza at the end. The \"Domine\" was a duet with Hélène and Julie, and the two of them couldn't have blended better. The final Benedictus was thrilling, finally welcoming back Gordon Bintner to fill out the beautiful ensemble.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tThe Amadeus Choir and the Elmer Iseler Singers sounded clean and powerful, and the TSO, as expected, continued the night with seasoned Mozart playing. It's a great night of music, even if you don't nerd out on the Mozart, obscure and famous. The concert reprises tomorrow night, January 24th at 7:30pm at Roy Thomson Hall, and Sunday January 25th at 3pm, at the George Weston Recital Hall. <a href=\"http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/concerts-and-tickets/2014-2015-Season/EventDetails/Mozart-Mass-in-C-Minor.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for tickets and details</a>.\n</p>",

It's not really an article about opera or the Met, but I'm inclined to weigh in on it on behalf of opera-goers, because this story edges towards the elitism amongst opera fans.</p><p>The short version: Collier was gifted with orchestra seats to the Met's current&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.metopera.org/opera/aida-verdi-tickets\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Aida</em></a>, priced at over $300 each.&nbsp;She goes with a friend,&nbsp;and before the show starts, the man in the seat behind her asked her to tie back her hair, which was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/collier/status/554012335564947457/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\">he said was&nbsp;blocking his view</a>. She does so, and then rethinks her decision at first intermission, starts recording on her phone, and tells the man she'll be letting her hair go free for Acts II and III. She quotes him:&nbsp;\"'No, you know what, you're really disgusting,' he says again, cementing his position. 'Who comes to the opera with hair sticking straight out of their head like that?' He's crossed into full-blown rant territory.\" Collier and her friend speak to an usher at the Met, and they get their seats moved.</p><p>At the second intermission, Collier goes to a different usher, explaining the issue with her neighbour: \"I want the dude to get yelled at, I tell him.\" After wielding her trusty phone recording of their first-intermission conversation, telling the new usher, \"I'm sure the Metropolitan Opera doesn't condone this sort of behavior [sic]. I'm sure you wouldn't want this sort of thing to get out.\" The usher says there's nothing more that can be done about the situation, and that she should call the police instead.</p><p>Finally, Collier turns her attention to what's happening&nbsp;with <em>Aida</em> onstage, and notices a&nbsp;\"big-ass wagon full of black bodies lying on top of one another. Whether they're dead or sleeping, Allison—who shoots me a crazy look—and I don't know.\" She also noticed that plenty of the singers weren't black, and there was even a white woman onstage with braids.</p><p>What that last bit had to do with her irate seat neighbour, I don't know. Now, it's true that the opera is fairly white, and it's been a long and winding road getting more black opera singers on stages like the Met. But am I the only one who thinks this story of irate opera-goers was unwisely conflated with the larger issue of diversity in the opera industry? I can't help but wonder if Collier would have drawn the same conclusions if she'd gone to see <a href=\"http://www.metopera.org/opera/the-merry-widow-lehar-tickets\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Merry Widow</em></a>.</p><p>Either way, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/collier/status/557930564851105792\" target=\"_blank\">the Met offered Collier complimentary two tickets</a> to a future show of her choice.</p>",

Stage directors Grace Smith (Wolf-Ferrari) and Opera 5 Artistic Director Aria Umezawa shared the double bill, bringing their unique styles to two pieces that couldn't have been more different. Music Director Evan Mitchell led the orchestra (which I believe is a first for Opera 5, so congrats!) impressively through two tricky scores. I thought it was Opera 5's best production yet. It was streamlined and cohesive, and both pieces stood well on their own. Get out and see one of the two remaining shows (<a href=\"http://www.operafive.com/season-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">details right here</a>).\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Il segreto di Susanna</em> is a comedy about a newlywed couple, still in honeymoon bliss. Susanna's big secret? She smokes. Her husband, Gil, sniffs out the smell of smoke in their home, and blows the secret entirely out of proportion, convinced that Susanna is having an affair with a smoker. Wolf-Ferrari's score is intricate and colourful; the piece revolves around high stakes comedy and layers of hidden secrets to be uncovered, and the music itself is amazingly specific.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428805769057/Jan-2015-0805.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x7eydqybHmgylok9F7-ZDj2AvMV3wlrev5_whb_0uUK1iGrnIjYmVL11uO7OXpmZoA047Xd-tu6iJQzKfSFalZaGvG0gtA\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x7eydqybHmgylok9F7-ZDj2AvMV3wlrev5_whb_0uUK1iGrnIjYmVL11uO7OXpmZoA047Xd-tu6iJQzKfSFalZaGvG0gtA=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Rachel Krehm (Susanna) and Christopher Mayell (Sante).

It's a great role for her, one that lets her relax into her full, strong sound. Her part is big and expansive, full of ingratiating lies told to her husband, or thorough enjoyment of her forbidden vice. I missed a bit of inflection of the text; I thought she could have risked more of a spoken sound, with the vocal power that she has.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.geoffreysirett.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Geoff Sirett</a> sings Gil, her husband, and he was a total master of theatrical comedy, with a thousand different voices. He had huge, tragic outbursts of jealousy over his wife's perceived affair, he knew which lines to deliver out to us, so we could be in on his plan for finding the truth. He tore about the house, looking for his wife's lover (\"Non c'è!!!\"), shooting back and forth across the stage like a cartoon. Classic, loved it.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428805811720/Jan-2015-0749.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6dxL7X8i_JHGfCkYt8yK-JtnBUk07AHwONTsv4YQYzq1iJmlRTDn1L3Gxsqxx9LKWANsAOt9ztCYSqZCrkV5dnefEt33\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6dxL7X8i_JHGfCkYt8yK-JtnBUk07AHwONTsv4YQYzq1iJmlRTDn1L3Gxsqxx9LKWANsAOt9ztCYSqZCrkV5dnefEt33=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Rachel Krehm (Susanna) and Geoffrey Sirett (Gil). Photo: Emily Ding</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://christophermayell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Mayell</a> played the mute role of Sante, the butler-type who tries to contain his mistress' secret without angering his master. It's so, <em>so</em> hard to do these silent roles well, because they're often meant to be a combination of comic relief and liaison between the other characters and the audience. Chris was hilarious, and he expertly established his relationships to Susanna and Gil, keeping them different and in conflict. Great stuff indeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe orchestra under Music Director<a href=\"http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/03/07/meet-the-new-face-of-the-kingston-symphony/\" target=\"_blank\"> Evan Mitchell</a> sounded great. It's a chamber-music-like score, with plenty of recurring themes in solo instruments and lots of rhythmic elasticity. In the recitatives I thought the orchestra sustained their harmonies too loudly, covering the subtleties in the singers' text. But it was great to have an orchestra, period; I'm excited for this step for Opera 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThen, we heard the world première of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/darrenrusso\" target=\"_blank\">Darren Russo</a>'s <em>Storybook</em>, with a libretto by Darren Russo, William Blake, Lauren J. Rogener, and Anonymous, which was originally inspired by William Blake's <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1934/1934-h/1934-h.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Songs of Innocence and Experience</em></a>. The opera is made up of seven scenes, sung by five singers whose characters are named for their voice type. Russo can describe it better than I in his composer's notes, \"The inhabitants of <em>Storybook</em> revisit moments of boundless imagination and dreary routine, childhood readiness and adult resignation, all emanating from a desire for meaningful contact, for expression and for understanding in a duplicitous world.\" The scenes aren't dramatically linear, but they gradually made tiny connections to each other in small ways, leaving a web of people who have had vague interaction with each other over the course of an hour.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428805866741/Jan-2015-0917.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q7Wm5Fx1lPxjmpaLia_bdrRRw83MwZ54y_hASFWVcedq7VA1-v3UBKd8eXxo9gw4H-vOZVQ-IUX4lMQRoEfg3yay4cohyQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q7Wm5Fx1lPxjmpaLia_bdrRRw83MwZ54y_hASFWVcedq7VA1-v3UBKd8eXxo9gw4H-vOZVQ-IUX4lMQRoEfg3yay4cohyQ=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Christopher Mayell in Darren Russo's <em>Storybook</em>. Photo: Emily Ding</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tMy initial reaction was that it sounded really neat. The colour palate in the orchestra was icy and tense, using string harmonics, <em>pizzicato</em>, electronic sounds, and probably other extended techniques that I couldn't identify. There was some pretty amazing choral writing for the singers, reminding me of some of Arvo Pärt's harmonies. Russo brought out moments in the libretto with musical effects imitating squeaking, and muffled sex from the next room; he wrote some amazing word painting on phrases like \"boiling point\" and \"crawling out of my skin\". Throughout the piece, there were multiple returns to quotes of childhood songs and nursery rhymes, like \"I am slowly going crazy, 1-2-3-4-5-6-switch!\" and \"\"Five little ducks went out one day, out one day...\". The counting in the nursery rhymes kept a structure to the piece, counting \"five little ducks\", then four, then three, etc. I thought it worked well, and the musical effect was always novel and evolving.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAria Umezawa directed the piece in an abstract way, seating the singers in one general space that allowed each character to have a private moment, or extend their space to other characters. I think it was the best way to visualize Russo's structure to <em>Storybook</em>, and it drew me in with its simplicity. The five singers were fantastic, and have to be commended for memorizing what seemed like a tricky score. <a href=\"http://www.leighannallen.com/home/\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh-Ann Allen</a> (Soprano),<a href=\"http://emmaparkinson.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Emma Parkinson</a> (Mezzo-Soprano), <a href=\"http://christophermayell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Mayell</a> (Tenor), <a href=\"http://www.geoffreysirett.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Geoff Sirett</a> (Baritone), and <a href=\"http://geoffreypenar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Geoffrey Penar</a> (Bass) were all fantastic as solo and ensemble artists. They rotated solo moments with group reactions to others' solo moments in a really fluid way. Emma Parkinson had a great aria/dream about wanting to go for a joint and a walk; Leigh-Ann Allen (whose voice is gorgeous, and we should hear her more) was tragic and innocent as a young boy who misses his father; Geoff Sirett had an incredible monologue about crawling out of one's skin, and then putting it back one. Pretty great texts, helped by a truly great cast.

I think <em>Storybook</em> is for a small- to medium-sized space, where the audience can get close and watch the details. My only issue was with the setting of the text. Russo used interesting rhythms and inflections, splitting up words, and often putting purposeful stress or length on the \"wrong\" syllable. I like the originality of the setting, but it really did make the text hard to understand. Surtitles were used again, but I wanted to be able to keep my eyes on the stage without having to check the titles; the texts were English, and their diction was good, but I thought the text setting created an unnecessary barrier between the piece and its listeners.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.operafive.com/season-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">Opera 5's </a><em><a href=\"http://www.operafive.com/season-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">Modern (Family) Opera</a> </em>runs until January 25th at the Arts and Letters Club, 14 Elm St. There are great singers, I like both shows, and I think <em>Storybook</em> is an important piece to see. <a href=\"http://www.operafive.com/season-tickets/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for details and to purchase tickets</a>.\n</p>",

It's the fifth year of Tapestry's New Opera 101 Program, which gives singers and pianists a chance to work on contemporary opera with some of the best in the business; the rep is chosen from within Tapestry's impressive library of commissions, and the artists get to work with the likes of Tapestry's Artistic Director <a href=\"https://tapestryopera.com/about#who-we-are\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Mori</a>, collaborative pianist <a href=\"http://www.music.utoronto.ca/faculty/faculty_members/faculty_n_to_z/steven_philcox.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Philcox</a>, and baritone <a href=\"http://petermcgillivray.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter McGillivray</a>. <em>Songbook V</em> is a showcase of the culmination of a hectic two-day workshop with all these artists, and we got to see it in a concert format of semi-staged scenes.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428805536855/10943744_10152774633088547_6124600343009489208_n.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WSCqJEkrXGJQIEPt7WYB_6lohqYlkmE1bJz-ptV7cu4mds7PWzF8t215uGxGeYiwDO-KStTTQu621N0tdkoU7KhmHBk\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WSCqJEkrXGJQIEPt7WYB_6lohqYlkmE1bJz-ptV7cu4mds7PWzF8t215uGxGeYiwDO-KStTTQu621N0tdkoU7KhmHBk=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Baritone Aaron Durand</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tPeter McGillivray and Steven Philcox treated us to a couple of numbers throughout the program, and the majority of the performances were given by the New Opera 101 participants. Considering both the short window of time, and the difficulty of the rep, the team of performers were exceptional. The pianists and singers drew me in so often, something I'm used to as a rare occurrence. I thought the rep was well-chosen; it was full of solos and duets that created one fascinating character after another. Among the strong program, there were a few standout performances for me.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBaritone Aaron Durand, with Narmina Afandiyeva at the piano, sang a scene from Kevin Morse and Krista Dalby's \n\t<em>Shaman's Tale</em>, in which he was the creepy, benevolently evil Shaman helping a couple struggling with infertility. Very Sweeney Todd, very Black Max, and really well sung; Narmina's playing matched the \"let me tell you a story\" sound that capped off the eerie factor.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMaeve Palmer and Jordan Collalto sang Chris Thornborrow and David Yee's \n\t<em>a little rain must</em> <em>fall</em>,<em> </em>a bizarrely funny comic opera in which a man accuses his girlfriend of killing all of his exes; at the end, mysteriously, he gets poisoned. The two of them, plus pianist Mélisande Sinsoulier, made a great comic team; Maeve calmly dodged Jordan's finger-pointing, and Jordan made himself look like a crazed accuser with hilariously massive vocal moments.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWith Anastasia Tchernikova at the piano, Heather Molloy and Michael Robert-Broder sang perhaps the weirdest scene I've ever seen in live theatre. \n\t<em>In This World, George Is Heartbroken</em>, by Lembit Beecher and Hanna Moscovitch, started off like an unhappy married couple, she hurling insults at him (\"You look like a pubic hair!\"), he verbally and physically abusive back at her (\"Don't talk to me like that, you c@&amp;*!\"). Then we realize that she's his mother, and the abuse piles on, and the whole scene turns super weird, super quickly. (*Correction: after a chat with AD Michael Mori, he informed me I'd misheard, and that he calls her \"Martha,\" not \"mother.\" Big difference.)\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428805612813/10329142_10152774632448547_5060201678186894996_n.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AISgVc0F_fJ91dBaiujOcOm1Ec1GIl-fh3Cm-g0daIxo5lnOFZNgzuQW2DyElEoqDPPO9MjyP474qhaE8LLUzwXXTBu4\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AISgVc0F_fJ91dBaiujOcOm1Ec1GIl-fh3Cm-g0daIxo5lnOFZNgzuQW2DyElEoqDPPO9MjyP474qhaE8LLUzwXXTBu4=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Pianist Steven Philcox and baritone Peter McGillivray</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tPeter McGillivray and Steven Philcox started and (nearly) finished the program with two expert performances. The first was \"Ladies and Gentlemen\", from Abigail Richardson and Alexis Diamond's \n\t<em>The Perfect Screw</em>, in which Peter sells us a screwdriver. Cue plenty of sexual innuendo, subtle and not-so, plus Peter-als-salesman, and it was a perfect way to start the night. Later they performed Raoul's Aria from Omar Daniel and Alex Poch-Goldin's <em>The Shadow</em>. Raoul has fallen for a girl, for whom he's not good enough, but decides to pursue her anyway. It was one of those scenes where the audience can't help but root for the hero. Peter and Steven were fantastic together; it was great to hear artists like this mixed in with younger performers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI'm so pleased that Tapestry hosts events like this, which circulated new (and likely obscure) Canadian opera in large quantities of shorts. We got a rich look at the Canadian opera scene with \n\t<em>Songbook V</em>, and I heard singers who were mostly new to me. The talent is promising, and the scenes are clever and entertaining. That's sort of all you need for good theatre, right? I say bravi to the whole team of <i>Songbook V</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t***\n</p>\n<h2>Greg:</h2>\n<p>\n\tLast night, (January 24th) Jenna and I were treated to a fabulous concert mounted by Tapestry, now being expertly steered by \n\t<a href=\"https://tapestryopera.com/about#who-we-are\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Mori</a> at the helm.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis concert series is something that Canadian opera audiences don't realize they're in desperate need of. During the introduction, Mori said something a lot of us have been thinking. Canada is extremely rich in new operatic works that get staged once, and never again see the light of day. It's is a travesty on all of our parts. This concert was a perfect eye-opener to let us in not only on the work Tapestry has been championing for years, but also to let us hear some amazing contemporary compositions which, unfortunately, if you missed their original mountings, it's going to be a long time before you heard any of it again.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe concert was a culmination of a series of masterclasses led by Tapestry alums Peter McGillivray and Steven Philcox. Joining these two amazing performers were 11 young singers and 5 top-drawer collaborative pianists presenting solos and duets from the 15 large commissions and (wait for it) 160 smaller commissions written by 8 different composer/librettist teams over the course of the night. I gotta say, the budding director in me is chomping at the bit to be let alone in their library for a few hours (nay, DAYS).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThese young singers made me very excited for the future of Canadian contemporary opera. They sang with a wide range of colours, techniques and presented some pretty complex characters for us to devour (which is not easy to do when you only have one number taken out of context to convey their story).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the interest of time and Internet real estate I'd like to share my highlight reel.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428805653220/1907937_10152774632058547_4518529430356817494_n.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ja6-VJqKP70nA60y43wqdy4SHAIzVbxDda_QGC5W6su9gu9cEY81vX59EUEfafb00FOLCHxN0ZPq-E9JnHokBarXUIptqA\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ja6-VJqKP70nA60y43wqdy4SHAIzVbxDda_QGC5W6su9gu9cEY81vX59EUEfafb00FOLCHxN0ZPq-E9JnHokBarXUIptqA=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Soprano Maeve Palmer</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tMcGillivray sang 2 numbers which not only flexed his caramelly baritone range but also let him show us his remarkable ability to share a character's complex thought process in a very short time. The first number from \n\t<em>The Perfect Screw</em> was chock-full of innuendo and double-entendre and a great lively way to start the show. His second was an aria from Omar Daniels'<em> The Shadow</em>. His portrayal of Raoul, the idealistic lover who decides to change his entire personage to impress a lady who's name he doesn't even know. His low end rung with a warmth that shone through the complex orchestra deftly mastered by Philcox. <em>The Shadow</em> is one of the many Tapestry shows I was forced to miss due to being on stage myself, but after hearing this I MUST see the whole thing. *Mori take note.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI really enjoyed Aaron Durand's portrayal of The Shaman from \n\t<em>The Shaman's Tale</em>. Aaron displayed a wide variety of colours that coupled with his attractive, friendly face drew you completely into his narrative. His ability to use his whole body in his characterizations is something I find a lot of young baritones forget to employ. Durand was later joined by mezzo Heather Molloy to present the duet,<em> (What Rhymes With) Azimuth</em>. In my opinion it was the loveliest piece of the night. Composed by Ivan Barbotin with a libretto by Liza Balkan, the colours the two created with their easy, clear voices and delicate nuances was a great way to close the show.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMolloy, probably the most versatile character singer I heard all night, has a great colour to her voice and an agility of diction that belies her years. Her other appearance was in a duet with baritone Michael Robert-Broder, entitled \n\t<em>In this World George is Heartbroken</em>. With music by Lembit Beecher and libretto by Hanna Moscovitch, this is an intense duet that both singers sang with skill, beauty and dramatic intent that would be welcome on any major stage in Canada. Kudos on keeping the music beautiful while sharing what are some clearly ugly human moments.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI would be remiss not to mention soprano Maeve Palmer. Oddly enough, she sang the roles of two killers. The circumstances of the killings varied greatly, but I saw nuances and choices in both that were scintillating and exciting, and will definitely have me keeping my eyes on this young soprano. Her duet partner Jodan Collalto, a tall, handsome baritone, was both charming and hilarious in his discovery of his new girlfirend's indiscretions. He's a young singer with a lot of voice. There's still some finessing to do over the top end, but I feel he's going to be another to keep an eye on.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI could go on \n\t<em>ad nauseum</em> about all the amazing music I heard all night. All these young singers are definitely on the right track, doing all the right things to A) solidify their place among Canada's great young singers and B) lead the charge in bringing contemporary Canadian opera into the big, broad, bright spotlight it deserves.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKudos to all involved! I had a splendid night and can't wait to hear all of you again!\n</p>\n<p class=\"intro\">\n\tIf you've not yet been able to catch Tapestry's work, this spring is a great time to start. \n\t<em>Tap:Ex Tables Turned</em>, featuring soprano Carla Huhtanen and composer/DJ Nicole Lizée, happens March 20-21st, and Tapestry's full-length collaboration with Scottish opera, <em>M'Dea Undone</em>, opens May 26th. <a href=\"https://tapestryopera.com/subscription\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> for season details and to purchase tickets.\n</p>",

        "body": "<p class=\"intro\">\n\tAfter much anticipation (and averting my eyes from the opening night reviews), I had the chance to see the COC's current production of \n\t<a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DonGiovanni.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Don Giovanni</em></a>, directed and designed by <a href=\"http://operabase.com/a/Dmitri_Tcherniakov/4289\" target=\"_blank\">Dmitri Tcherniakov</a>, and conducted by <a href=\"http://www.michaelhofstetter.com/biography.html\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Hofstetter</a>. The production was new to me, and my curiosity was piqued by some press photos and a few rumoured details. Plus, there would be a new conductor in the pit, and an exciting cast, which was a good mix of no-brainers (Russell Braun) and familiar voices singing new roles (Jane Archibald).<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs expected, the singing in this \n\t<em>Giovanni </em>was stellar from Anna to Zerlina. In the title role was Russell Braun, returning to one of his signature roles in his signature opera house. It was so wonderful to be able to hear him sing this music, which he clearly loves and knows so well. He sang with a schizophrenic rang of colour, from morose and apathetic, to manically excited; he took enormous risks (high A!) and brought us close up with his \"Deh vieni alla finestra\". Many of his choices, like the pacing of recitative, came from this production; it made me curious to ask Russell about his own ideas about Da Ponte's libretto.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCanadian fave \n\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/archibaldjane\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Archibald</a> made her role debut as Donna Anna, and I thought it was a beautiful fit for her. The agility in her voice allowed us to hear every note, which is a hard compromise for sopranos with more expanse. The result was that Jane's Donna Anna sounded young and fragile; if she had been staged as a true victim of Giovanni's, it would have been totally believable. Her \"Non mi dir\" was a highlight of the night for me.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428804402916/DonGiovanni-MC-0707.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i0GYCANNYdnLR-2PnaKZYjKQMdL8HE7fOg1TGYAIpoKhgitEBQtKQurI0l-JdLSTINoQpLuRgIX5Nnv0zdl_1u7mtEvP\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i0GYCANNYdnLR-2PnaKZYjKQMdL8HE7fOg1TGYAIpoKhgitEBQtKQurI0l-JdLSTINoQpLuRgIX5Nnv0zdl_1u7mtEvP=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Jane Archibald (Anna) and Michael Schade (Ottavio). Photo: Michael Cooper</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tAnother highlight was \n\t<a href=\"http://kyleketelsen.instantencore.com/web/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle Ketelsen</a>'s singing of Leporello. He carried clearly and easily through the hall; he always had a dark warmth in his sound, whether he was chattering <em>recit</em> or singing with his full voice. Kyle blended beautifully with Russell as Giovanni, but their respective consistent sounds kept their two voices distinct.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Donna Elvira, \n\t<a href=\"/talking-with-singers-jennifer-holloway/\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Holloway</a> had some of the most exciting musical moments of the night. She seemed to have no problems at all with this notoriously difficult role, including a really easy top that had ring as well as guts. Jennifer has a few pants roles under her belt as well, and I loved that there seemed to be something strong in her top (masculine, almost?), that gave power to her Elvira. Her \"Mi tradì\" was totally stunning, expertly sung and exciting to watch. Most of the cast was onstage with her, a departure from the traditional monologue setting, and I thought Jennifer made great use of her \"audience\", almost screaming that great text into the vacant faces of her family. This was her COC debut, and I hope she'll be back soon.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sashadjihanian\" target=\"_blank\">Sasha Djihanian</a> was a spunky, unpredictable, obsessive Zerlina. Physically, she exuded youth and innocence; the strength in her voice gave her character more depth. She sang \"Vedrai, carino\" with <em>gravitas</em> and beautiful line, less flirty and more protective; again, I was curious about Sasha's own ideas about this scene, since both of her arias had different dramatic motivation than I expected. As Masetto,<a href=\"http://www.cami.com/?webid=2402\" target=\"_blank\"> Zachary Nelson</a> had a gorgeous, almost dangerous sound that I loved loved loved, and I want to hear him in a role that shows more. He'll return as <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1516Season/Carmen.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Escamillo next season</a>, so I'll get that chance. <a href=\"http://operabase.com/a/Michael_Schade/12336\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Schade</a>, another Canadian favourite, sang Don Ottavio with lots of detail and nuance; he gave more spark and personality to Ottavio than we usually see, which worked well in this production. I was pleased that they hadn't cut \"Dalla sua pace\". As the Commendatore, bass <a href=\"http://www.andreasilvestrelli.com/bmd/biography.html\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea Silvestrelli</a> had the most surprising, humungous voice I'd heard in a long time. It was wide open, a quality I love in a bass, and the sound was a little wild. It was definitely menacing for his final appearance at dinner.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428804450546/DonGiovanni-MC-0871_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/it6yaKeAyi5zgEEmh4RMWY0OC7-z7_2GjWnlGSglD_Ly1P9IMrsaSoNtswDiSA_R6DWru2PiRHO2wSnp77AdhN38LKfhZg\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/it6yaKeAyi5zgEEmh4RMWY0OC7-z7_2GjWnlGSglD_Ly1P9IMrsaSoNtswDiSA_R6DWru2PiRHO2wSnp77AdhN38LKfhZg=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Zachary Nelson (Masetto) and Sasha Djihanian (Zerlina).

That's a lotta \n\t<em>recit;</em> bravo! At times the orchestra overwhelmed the singers onstage, and I thought some moments were a little too thick. I had a personal bias for quicker tempi than maestro Hofstetter's, and I felt a few of the singers wanted to move along a bit as well.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t*Before I talk about the production, I'd like to start with a disclaimer: I have worked with the COC, and I've had nothing but positive and inspiring experiences with the company. I think a great function of the COC is to bring the international opera scene to Toronto, and my criticisms of Dmitri Tcherniakov's production are not criticisms of the COC's decision to include it in their 2014/15 season.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his production of \n\t<em>Don Giovanni</em>, Tcherniakov places the characters in one household, and creates a new web of relationships between them. Don Giovanni is married to Donna Elvira, whose cousin is Donna Anna. Zerlina is Anna's daughter, and Leporello is vaguely related to the rest of them. The timeline is also changed; instead of the action happening over 24 hours, the scenes are spread out, separated by days and weeks (punctuated by a dramatic, quickly falling curtain that probably created a breeze for the first few rows).  Finally, the entire cast spends huge amounts of time onstage, having characters present in scenes that are intended to happen in their absence. This combination of decisions created a lot of problems onstage.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe night felt like a concept stretched much too thinly over the score and libretto. \n\t<em>Don Giovanni</em> has much to say about human nature, sexuality, and morality, and this is all said through this opera that is earthy and tangible and largely available at face value. Tcherniakov decided to sacrifice a sensical story for the sake of his newly created web of characters. They weren't uninteresting characters, but they certainly wouldn't have spoken the lines that were in the Da Ponte libretto.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428804490412/DonGiovanni-MC-1232_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2wMIFrC2fcaDx4DBN9dGqPV5Li2bRfRffqVdrcjq-EfPlhvdxZe1no9SrfLHnjJZVU-V3DDPxIRvH0xvvYuOm9G71wkUYw\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2wMIFrC2fcaDx4DBN9dGqPV5Li2bRfRffqVdrcjq-EfPlhvdxZe1no9SrfLHnjJZVU-V3DDPxIRvH0xvvYuOm9G71wkUYw=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Kyle Ketelsen (Leporello), Russell Braun (Giovanni), and Jennifer Holloway (Elvira). Photo: Michael Cooper</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tSo many of Tcherniakov's decisions went against Mozart.\n</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The curtain opened to silence for an uncomfortable amount of time, and then the overture began randomly. Why not when the curtain goes up? Or when the Commendatore sits in his seat?</li>\n\t<li>There were characters exiting and re-entering in the middle of their scene, or finishing a line from offstage for no particularly obvious reason.</li>\n\t<li>Donna Anna sees Don Giovanni kill the Commendatore, apparently accidentally. Her frantic <em>recit</em> that happens right after her father dies seems odd and redundant, because Tcherniakov sets this scene five days after the murder.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family: Lato, Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\" rel=\"font-family: Lato, Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Elvira, Giovanni's very unhappy wife, sings her first lines deliberately within earshot of Giovanni and Leporello, making a strange power game out of her now rhetorical questions \"ah! chi mi dice mai...\", and Giovanni's \"poverina\" line directed right at Elvira. This was interesting to me, but the execution seemed off.</span></li>\n\t<li>When Giovanni and Leporello are disguised as each other, they simply exchange a coat. No mask, lights are on, whatever. But Giovanni and Leporello come up with the disguise plan right in front of Elvira. I get it, it makes her some sort of manipulated slave of Giovanni's, but there are specific lines that were nonsensical in this new scene. The entire sextet warranted questions: Leporello, why can't you find your way out of the place you live? Elvira, why can't you find \"Giovanni\" in the same room as you with the lights on and no mask?</li>\n\t<li>There was a Graveyard Scene, under a chandelier (that didn't nod, but I'd buy it). But then the return of the Commendatore in the Act II finale turned out to be a look-alike (still sung by Andrea Silvestrelli), paid off by Ottavio. Everyone, including a reluctant Elvira, had conspired to try and scare Giovanni to death.</li>\n\t<li>The Vienna ending: I don't mind this version, but it's weird for Leporello to narrate what happened to everyone, when the whole thing was apparently their idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\tStuff like that. Perhaps it seems like boring critique to nag about the plot making sense, but it's this kind of superimposition that arms the argument against \n\t<em>Regieoper</em>. It felt as though Tcherniakov wanted to create the dark, incestuous household of the Commendatore, and opted to ignore the plot holes that surfaced as a result. I don't think it's conservative to start with the score and libretto, and give a fair go at taking the piece at face value. There are archaic hurdles that make <em>Don Giovanni</em> a difficult piece to direct already, and this production added so many more. Tcherniakov told what seemed like a story of women with low self-esteem and a manic protagonist in the midst of his many highs and lows. If only the text and music had told the same tale.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe singing is fantastic, and worth hearing while it's here. \n\t<em>Don Giovanni</em> runs until February 21st; <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DonGiovanni.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> for more details and to purchase tickets.\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\tOn Sunday afternoon I went to see<a href=\"http://www.operainconcert.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> VOICEBOX: Opera In Concert</a>'s production of <a href=\"http://www.operainconcert.com/Street.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Street Scene</em> </a>at the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts. Kurt Weill's \"American Opera\", with text by Elmer Rice and Langston Hughes, is a fantastic piece, and I agreed with Artistic Director Guillermo Silva-Marin when he said that the show doesn't get done enough. I've had the personal fortune to work on two productions of <em>Street</em> <em>Scene</em>;<em> </em>and it's a beautifully written story about people we all understand, and about real life, which doesn't adhere to happy endings or perfect timing. <em>Street Scene</em> is one of those great ensemble pieces, with a large cast, each one vital in creating Weill's world, where the characters are equal parts unique people, and representative of different facets of human nature. The big cast also calls for lots of different kinds of singing (and I think it's a great show to put up at schools and summer programs), and it was a good choice for Opera In Concert, which does a great job of putting Canada's talent onstage.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI'll chat about some of my highlight performances from the show (you should <a href=\"http://www.operainconcert.com/Street.html\" target=\"_blank\">click here for a full cast list</a>). As Anna Maurrant, unhappily married and confined by her life, soprano <a href=\"http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/monica-whicher-emc/\" target=\"_blank\">Monica Whicher</a> was really moving. She sang with an easy ring in her voice, making Anna sound like she still had some youth and idealism inside of her. Even in the Act II scene where she tries to stand up to her belligerent husband, there was still fragility and a bit of fear in her voice. We were easily sympathetic to Anna Maurrant, and Monica, always an expert in singing in English, she made it easy to capture the audience with her fantastic text.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428804234680/JenniferTaverner.jpeg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d68BUJN-CXOvhrnD6w9Uqow2e8k68nzMCeWxSaYTeQq6mabtz8mz_bwWHI1rmVoUdQ-oxZbNP_1c0rqqTNSCznznNR4-\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d68BUJN-CXOvhrnD6w9Uqow2e8k68nzMCeWxSaYTeQq6mabtz8mz_bwWHI1rmVoUdQ-oxZbNP_1c0rqqTNSCznznNR4-=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Soprano Jennifer Taverner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tAs Anna's daughter, Rose Maurrant, <a href=\"http://www.jennifertaverner.com/Jennifer_Taverner,_Soprano/Jennifer_Taverner.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Taverner</a> was beautiful. She had a lightness in her voice that sounded Rose's age, with enough richness to portray her as a wise young woman. She actually sounded similar to Monica, which worked beautifully to establish that Rose and Anna had thoughtfulness and loneliness in common. The role of Rose is deceptively big, but Jennifer made it sound easy. I also thought she was a strong actor, using both the dialogue and the music to help us understand her character.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTenor <a href=\"http://www.colinainsworth.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Colin Ainsworth</a> was perfect as Sam Kaplan, in my opinion one of the saddest characters in the opera repertoire. His \"Lonely House\" was a highlight for me, and Colin used that grainy, honest sound of his as well as a gorgeous falsetto moment at the end. After his Act I love(ish) duet with Rose, he ended the act with a wide, familiar smile that had us all on Sam's side. It made that awful line he says after his final duet with Rose even worse: \"Oh Rose, this is the end of my world.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the exhausting and unpredictable Frank Maurrant, Diego Català had a warm sound that felt more like a baritone than a bass. He sang well and his text was clear, but he lacked some of the danger that I want in the character. There were a few moments where Frank was \"onstage\" within the loose staging; I can't remember if the stage directions in the score call for him to be present for numbers like the \"Ice Cream Sextet\", but I felt the in-concert setting had Diego present, and engaged, in comic-relief scenes that weakened his role as a man to be feared.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428804267245/colin_ainsworth_c_kevin_clarknr_bio.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2ZyxNuLWUma0e0uTx-sbxOh2ibkUrqtf8dszkheAsf-g58rTUQl4kzytCcSYm5IkPahw_wsLUi0Rr7K43i_w9_2M_Iqa\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2ZyxNuLWUma0e0uTx-sbxOh2ibkUrqtf8dszkheAsf-g58rTUQl4kzytCcSYm5IkPahw_wsLUi0Rr7K43i_w9_2M_Iqa=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Tenor Colin Ainsworth. Photo: Kevin Clark</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tI love <em>Street Scene</em> for all its small roles, of which <a href=\"http://www.operainconcert.com/Street.html\" target=\"_blank\">you can find the full list here</a>. Again, I'll go for the highlights: <a href=\"http://www.leighannallen.com/home/\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh-Ann Allen</a> and <a href=\"http://amicimusicschool.com/meet-our-teachers/\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Garlough</a> were fantastically catty as Mrs. Fiorentino and Mrs. Jones, two of my favourite bitches in opera. I thought Julia Henderson was adorable as the newly graduated Jennie Hildebrand, who has a her 15 minutes of fame in her graduation gown (despite her and her mother's looming foreclosure, darkness à-la-Weill). Of course, as Abraham Kaplan, the fab <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregory_finney\" target=\"_blank\">Gregory Finney</a> showed us his character's entire biography in his few, philosophizing lines, including a convincing old-man-hobble.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tUnder the baton of <a href=\"http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/robert-cooper-emc/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Cooper</a>, the chorus and orchestra sounded great. For the chorus and the soloists, I could tell that the English text had been coached with diligence and the singers gave us admirably clear text. I thought that the dialects were off, though; so many of the wet T's and D's were welcome for clarity, but it took me out of the show's setting to have people speaking what would be closer to British English. Not everyone did it, like Greg Finney as Kaplan; his text was clear but natural, adding fuel to my long-standing theory that singing clear English isn't about spitting out every letter.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's not an easy score, and I thought that Cooper and the orchestra handled the flexible music and all its stylistic homages: cabaret, jazz, blues, opera, and probably lots more. Shout out to the solo violin part at the beginning of \"Lonely House\"; it's one of those musical moments that will <em>always</em> sound better on the violin than at the piano. My only quibble was the electric keyboard given to pianist Narmina Afandiyeva; I know well the dilemma of portable keyboards over heavy/unavailable/expensive pianos (even an upright would have been great), but the keyboard sounds did take me out of the sonic world of Weill at a few moments.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Street Scene</em>, while it's a stellar piece and a great opportunity for young talent, is tricky to really present in a concert setting. There were a few scenes, like the \"Ice Cream Sextet\", and Jennie's graduation, that made the scenes seem more disjunct than they actually are. But <em>Street Scene</em> is truly extraordinary show and a personal favourite of mine, so I was more than happy to see that it was playing in Toronto at all, be it in-concert. Too bad there was just the one show. Bravi, all!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tComing up at the St. Lawrence Centre: Toronto Operetta Theatre presents <a href=\"http://www.torontooperetta.com/shows.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Earnest, The Importance of Being</em></a>, April 29-May 3, starring Cameron McPhail and Charlotte Knight.

        "body": "**Jenna:** Opera Atelier has opened its run of Gluck's [_Orpheus and Eurydice_](http://www.operaatelier.com/season/14-15-season/), set to play until April 19th at the Elgin Theatre. OA presented Berlioz's version of the score, which is one of the company's first dips into 19th-century repertoire, tangental as the dip may be. I'm not hugely familiar with the piece, and so the differences in Berlioz's version weren't apparent to me as a listener; I'd be curious to compare the scores. I do know that Gluck's score has moments of stunning beauty, and really neat orchestra effects (perhaps augmented by Berlioz) that sound ahead of their time.\n\n**Jenna:** The cast of singers is tiny; [Peggy Kriha Dye](https://www.facebook.com/peggykrihadyeofficial) sang a lovely and clear Eurydice, [Meghan Lindsay](http://www.meghanlindsay.com/) flaunted a bright sound and a trouser-role affect as Amour, and mezzo-soprano [Mireille Lebel](http://www.mireillelebel.com/) returned Opera Atelier as Orpheus. Lebel has a sweet sound, making me think of roles like Cherubino and Annio (which are on her résumé); unfortunately, she didn't carry well in the hall. The role seemed very low for her (and most mezzos today, I imagine), and we lost a lot of the affect in Gluck's low writing for Orpheus. Lebel sounded much more comfortable in a higher tessitura, but I was missing the clarity in the coloratura passages. I wouldn't mind hearing Lebel in a different role; I've found that Gluck roles tend to lie in the cracks between the divisions of the voice types of today. Peggy Kriha Dye sang Eurydice with beautiful connection between voice and body. She has a single, extended scene in which she goes from excitement over seeing Orpheus, to suspicion at his lack of eye contact, to despair. I thought she paced it beautifully and always used her voice as her primary tool. Meghan Lindsay was spunky as Amour, and hers was some of the most interesting music of the night. Trouser roles for a soprano are decidedly rare, but Meghan was strutting around with great masculine energy, and full of youth.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428865673577/Orpheus5_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Mireille Lebel (Orpheus), Peggy Kriha Dye (Eurydice) and Meghan Lindsay (Amour). Photo by Bruce Zinger.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n**Greg:** I want to preface everything I say with this: I'm a huge Atelier fan, a lot of my friends and colleagues work with them and I have loved a lot of their shows in the past. Unfortunately for me _Orpheus and Eurydice_ falls flat. Not because anything was anyone's fault, but because I felt the fight to keep the ancient form and traditions worked against any modern sensibility applied to the staging, characterizations, or technical and design choices.\n\n**Greg:** The singing, as per usual, was fantastic, although I found that the house was a little unforgiving to Ms. Lebel's Orpheus. She has an interesting colour, a stellar chest voice, a lovely bloom over the top and and a résumé to die for; I just wish I could have heard more of her, especially her coloratura and her mid-voice. I felt at times she may have been struggling with the material, as some of the melismas got a little cloudy in the turns and mordents. Excellent trouser characterization, however I didn't feel connected to Orpheus' loss, and found myself struggling to believe that the gods would oblige his request. Meghan Lindsay as Amour was charming, devilish, and sang with a light, clear soprano that reminded me of champagne. Her characterization of Amour as sort of a playboy, man-about-town was a lovely choice to help contrast the moment of truth in the finale ultimo where Eurydice is revived. Peggy Kriha-Dye was stunning. A lovely agile, feminine soprano who utilizes all the gifts she was given to help add the drama needed for such a role. I felt she was by far the strongest actor in the trio and her work after intermission when reunited with Orpheus was what I was waiting for all night. Strife, sadness and pain oozed out of this effortless soprano that sounded quite large. I feel like this may be the first time I've seen/heard Peggy, but I can assure you it won't be the last. The chorus sang the French repertoire quite well, although there were a few tempo discrepancies between the pit and the choir loft - an affliction with which I can totally relate when there's that much distance between you and the pit.\n\n**Jenna:** The production, I found frustrating. I often struggle with the stylization of Artistic Director [Marshall Pynkoski](http://www.operaatelier.com/about/creative-team/)'s direction, which make use of Baroque gesture and dramatic affectation to tell the story. I think it comes down simply to taste on my end, but I found that this production of _Orpheus_ highlighted my reasons for apprehension. The gestures and poses seemed particularly devoid of motivation; they simply happened in succession, like gesture-by-numbers. The singers were physically committed to their poses, and were always beautiful; but it didn't always feel genuine. I understand what the gestures mean, but the irony here was that the reason for the affectation was covered up by the stylized production. The _human_ parts of this story, like Orpheus' passage through various stages of grief, and Eurydice's very personal insecurities, are what keeps this myth a relevant story. For me, the aesthetic didn't allow for human qualities, and so the expressions of grief or joy seemed disingenuous.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428865853817/Orpheus2_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Mireille Lebel (Orpheus) with Artists of Atelier Ballet. Photo by Bruce Zinger.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n**Greg:** I felt like the whole production may have been rushed in its assembly. Marshall's staging, which can be formulaic due to the demands of the house, is not designed for opera, and it's a little unforgiving in reminding you of that. The solution is to stage everything along the proscenium arch - which is also how they would have done it in the 17th and 18th centuries. The problem is it limits the angles in which the singers can place themselves so that the voice can still travel predominantly into the house. I find Pynkoski's other productions are much better at hiding this formula among the dramatic intent of the narrative. The two ladies in pants roles however gave a masterclass in 18th century masculinity. It was quite impressive.\n\n**Greg:** The set design was the usual Gerard Gauci-Baroque-painting-inspired loveliness. The only thing I longed for was more of a distinction between the temple of Eurydice's monument and the gates of Hades - unfortunately called \"Hell\" a few times in the surtitles (but we'll forgive a poetic translation this time, even if it muddies up the myth). The sets were lovely and stunning, I just wish there was a way they could change them without dropping the curtain 4 times. It's probably my \"classical theatre\" showing, but I have a real problem with curtains coming down between overture and intermission (and also from intermission to \"curtain\" - the theatre term for the end of the show). The lighting was interesting. There were moments of magic, but I felt the whole thing a little too dark in the wrong places. Often times I found the trio of ladies' faces difficult to see.\n\n**Jenna:** The Opera Atelier Ballet were beautiful as always, and they had lots of stage time in this production. Pynkoski mentioned in his pre-show talk that Berlioz had left the final ballet out of his version, stating that he would have kept them, had he the resources to perform them. Artistic Director Jeannette Lajeunesse Zingg gave the task to the Atelier dancers, and it was a great opportunity to show off more of their individual techniques. I'll leave the details to Greg, since he's the one with the dance background.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428865919503/Orpheus3_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Artists of Atelier Ballet. Photo by Bruce Zinger.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n**Greg:** I'm a big fan of the OA Ballet. These dancers do some incredible work. The period choreography, the costumes, the shoes all fabulous. That being said, I felt this production was a little _over_ choreographed and maybe a little over populated. I lost a lot of footwork amongst all the bodies and there were moments of spacing issues, and a few of the men seemed a little tentative on the transitions - this could be chalked up to nerves. There were a few debuts noted in the program. I do have to give honourable mention to the second _pas-de-deux_ in the finale. It was athletic, graceful, tasteful and well executed. The young couple who danced it, Julia Sedgwick and Dominic Who, have a lovely future ahead of them on the stage.\n\n**Jenna:** The Tafelmusik Orchestra sounded spectacular throughout the night. Maestro Fallis let the drama bubble through Gluck's score, which seemed full of sudden and fleeting moments of beauty; the orchestra made sure we heard all of them. They were particularly great at managing the balance issues with the low tessitura for Orpheus\n\n**Greg:** Tafelmusik is awesome. Full Stop.\n\n**Jenna:** The production ended bizarrely, turning on a dime from a dark story of grief, to a happy ending that includes glitter, cannons of confetti, and the Atelier Ballet carrying cheerleader-type lettered placards that spelled out \"L'amour triomphe,\" and later \"#OAOrpheus.\" Yep. I do like that Pynkoski always has a sense of humour in his productions, be it subtle or bold. I often feel that OA productions present all the elements of opera - the music, the sets and costumes, the dancing, the physical aesthetic - in an undoubtedly beautiful and skilful way; yet these elements seem disconnected, as though they're happening beside each other on the same stage. I've seen Pynkoski's aesthetic work brilliantly in previous OA productions, but the organicism was missing from this _Orpheus_.\n\n**Greg:** Overall it's an enjoyable evening out, I would go see it if I were you. Although the application of social media branding left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, I was clearly in the minority feeling that way. The audience loved it.",

        "body": "<p>\n\tToday at noon, a few members of the <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx\">Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio</a> gave a concert in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, as part of the <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/FreeConcertSeries.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/FreeConcertSeries.aspx\">Free Concert Series</a> (which you should all get to know). The theme was \"Poetic Love,\" and the programming wasted no time getting to the point. Baritone <a href=\"http://www.ariamanagement.com/en/nos-artistes/gordon-bintner-w/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.ariamanagement.com/en/nos-artistes/gordon-bintner-w/\">Gordon Bintner</a> and pianist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/szetojenn\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"https://twitter.com/szetojenn\">Jennifer Szeto</a> gave us selections of Schubert's <em>Schwanengesang</em>, focusing on the six songs with texts by Heinrich Heine. Following that were tenor <a href=\"http://www.andrewhaji.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.andrewhaji.com/\">Andrew Haji</a> and Head of the Ensemble Studio, <a href=\"http://schmopera.com/how-to-be-a-coach-with-liz-upchurch/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"/how-to-be-a-coach-with-liz-upchurch/\">Liz Upchurch</a>, performing Schumann and Heine's incredible cycle, <em>Dichterliebe</em>. As many music lovers probably do, I have a weak spot for Schumann's story of love and all its forms: new, passionate, unrequited, lost, maybe imaginary. Despite having less of a visceral connection to Schubert's set, I had a feeling that the entire concert would be a winning combination of artists and repertoire, and I was right.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGordon sang with fantastic energy and attention to detail. He has a hugely expressive face when he sings, and it helped to draw the audience into each song's world. I realized it had been a while since I heard Gordon in an intimate, recital setting like in the Amphitheatre. Impressively, he brought all the commitment and storytelling stage presence of his work on the larger stage to this small set of songs. It was as if Gordon was delivering a more subtle version of his opera-self, but he never stopped using his voice as his primary tool. At the piano, Jennifer Szeto played with sensitivity and lots of thought to the quality of her sound. She fed off of Gordon's endless energy, even in songs like \"Der Doppelgänger,\" where the piano part is nothing but solid chords separated by unnerving amounts of time. I thought it was a really polished performance from both of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLiz Upchurch prefaced her and Andrew Haji's <em>Dichterliebe</em> with a short dedication to the late <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/arts/music/dietrich-fischer-dieskau-german-baritone-dies-at-86.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/arts/music/dietrich-fischer-dieskau-german-baritone-dies-at-86.html\">Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</a>. I was reminded of Fischer-Dieskau's singing of this set, and all the risks he took to tell the story. If I had any preferences for a specific version of <em>Dichterliebe</em>, they were gone as soon as Haji started to sing. His voice sounded flexible and easy throughout, and most importantly, he sang with an honest sound; I think it was the honesty that made it so easy for me to listen to this set (that I know well) with new ears. Haji managed that rare singer's feat of forgetting about the singing, so we could simply watch these scenes unfold. <em>Dichterliebe</em> always plays in my head like an old film, with the transitions from song to song (or scene to scene) being the most difficult part. He spoke each word as though it were happening to him at that moment, and did a really beautiful job of finding his own dramatic transition between songs. Whatever Haji was thinking about during that gorgeous final piano postlude, it was stunning to watch.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf that weren't enough, Liz Upchurch at the piano was a complete treat to hear. She played so thoughtfully, and with such a huge palate of sound colours, that she too brought out new parts of <em>Dichterliebe</em> and said new things about the story. Speaking of the gorgeous piano postlude, the <em>happiness</em> she brought to that music...right in the heart, Liz.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, a dreary day in Toronto, but another beautiful concert by these artists.

        "body": "## 1\\. Who is Violetta?\n\nI see Violetta as a woman who will do whatever it takes to to survive. She's been forced to grow up quickly as a courtesan, but she has managed to create a name and place for herself in Parisian society, sacrificing her own dreams and happiness for financial security. Her dreams of true love are reignited when she meets Alfredo, and she decides to give up financial stability to follow her heart. I think most people have a dream from our youth buried within us, that we chose not to pursue for pragmatic reasons. For me, Violetta is an everywoman in that sense. \n\n## 2\\. How common or universal is the story of _La traviata_?\n\nAs I stated above with the character of Violetta, I feel the story is one everyone feels a connection with. For example, we spend a great deal of time in superficial encounters. Exchanges of \"how are you?\" and \"fine, thanks\" are often done by rote. We self-censor on social media, and only share statuses and 'selfies' that paint us in a positive light. But I think, deep down, we are all striving to find those people in our lives with whom we can move past the superficial and be completely genuine. Violetta leaves the business of satisfying others when Alfredo's genuine concern for her opens her up to a sincere relationship. Later, his father speaks to her plainly and truthfully about their family, and she leaves so that Alfredo doesn't lose his family connections. I think these powerful relationships and brutally honest, emotionally raw scenes are the strength of the opera.\n\n## 3\\. What does Verdi have to say about women with _La traviata_, and the character of Violetta?\n\nThe way Verdi has written the character of Violetta points to a more modern view of women than we would expect for his time. She is a strong, independent woman in a society where women are normally chained to men, even though her freedom hangs on the satisfaction of men, so it is always within the context of a man's world. By giving up moral respectability to become a courtesan, she has gained freedom, financial security, and the ability to make her own decisions. At the same time this level of personal freedom carries the caveat of being categorized in a class from which there is no escape. Perhaps a small price to pay for a level of privilege that wouldn't be afforded her any other way.\n\n## 4\\. What's it like to sing such an iconic role?\n\nFor an artist, sometimes it can be intimidating to sing the iconic roles. With Violetta, I feel a certain sense of freedom in that there is not a right or wrong way to be Violetta. Many, many sopranos have made her their own. I have found my own personal connection to the text and music provided by Piave and Verdi. It is my job to make the audience feel that connection too. That connection will help my Violetta move the audience, in the context of such a great story. \n\n## 5\\. Why is _La traviata_ a good choice for Oshawa Opera?\n\nOshawa has made some big changes in the past few years. It's becoming a university city, and the arts & culture sector is growing there. [Oshawa Opera](http://www.theoshawaopera.com/) is a wonderful part of that growth. \n\n_La traviata_ is one of the most beloved operas. The characters are accessible, the music is powerful, and like most operas, the story has deep emotional resonance. That makes it a great choice if you haven't tried opera before, and also a favourite of many people who already love opera.",

        "body": "## 1\\. All of you have experience working in a large scale (symphony orchestras, large opera houses). What changes when the ensemble becomes small, as with this concert?  \n\n**Serouj**: The process of making music is more intimate, more one-on-one and there are more possibilities to explore different interpretation of any given passage in the work. \n\n**Mireille**: It is great fun to make music in a small group after performing in large venues and with large orchestras. You can be quite daring with your musical choices - singing and playing extremely softly, or using subtle colour and musical choices that might not normally be heard through the texture of a larger ensemble. As a singer, I find that the scale of the group and the performance space especially influences my approach to diction. I can \"speak\" more intimately to the audience, and temper consonants so that they sound more natural and balanced than what might be required over a gigantic orchestra in a huge space. \n\nOn a more basic level, you also get to explore a completely different world of repertoire! And it's a real luxury to be able to do so with musicians of Joaquin, David, and Serouj's caliber. \n\n**David**: In a chamber ensemble we are free to interpret the music as we wish as we need no conductor. We can interact musically with one another on a much more personal level. We are also able to choose our own programmes and invite wonderful guests such as Mireille to join us. \n\n## 2\\. Mireille, how do you make the transition between your large-scale work in opera, to a self-contained chamber group?\n\n**Mireille**: I find that it's simply a matter of listening more intently. Chamber music is a real team sport! Everyone is an equal partner and you feed off of each other's musical ideas in a truly collaborative fashion. Of course, I'm not saying that I don't listen to my colleagues in other settings (blasphemous words!!) - only that without a conductor at the helm holding everything together, we must each individually lead, follow, react, make decisions, inspire and be inspired in turn. That requires a real sensitivity to your colleagues' choices and needs. \n\n## 3\\. Amici, does the addition of a singer change anything among your ensemble?\n\n**Serouj**: The human voice and the text of the song add a new dimension to our musical approach and enrich the expressiveness of each of our instruments. \n\n**David**: With a singer we are able to perform an entirely different sort of repertoire which has everything to do with relating to the words and the subject matter of the piece. We have to be more flexible so that the singer can be free to express themselves and the meaning of the music. \n\n## 4\\. Can you tell us about how you chose the repertoire for this concert? What does the title \"The Shepherd\" mean to the program?\n\n**Mireille**: I will defer to Amici for this one! They simply sent me some rep ideas, which I loved, and we went with it. I was especially intrigued by the Tavener - they did a wonderful job constructing a diverse, challenging, and interesting program! \n\n**David**: With the _Shepherd on the Rock,_ Franz Schubert wrote one of the most beautiful and challenging of works for soprano in a chamber music setting. He has been an inspiration for all composers writing for the voice and we wanted to feature inspirational composers of the 20th century as well. John Tavener writes beautifully for the voice and his focus is often Russian liturgical music. Hence, the decision to devote half of the program to Russian composers. \n\n**Serouj**: There is clearly a shortage of works which feature the voice in a chamber music setting. And what better way to honour the composer and the most renowned work for that setting then to name an entire program after it. \n\n## 5\\. How do you find audiences in Toronto, in comparison with your experience in other major cities?\n\n**David**: We have a very loyal and supportive audience in Toronto. We consider them all to be part of Amici and enjoy very much seeing them at all of our concerts. It used to be said that Toronto audiences didn't appreciate local artists and preferred international musicians who had an established reputation. We find that has changed, as is demonstrated by the large number of local musicians who play chamber music in Toronto to great acclaim. \n\n**Serouj**: Knowledgeable, and not stingy in showing their appreciation for a good performance. \n\n**Mireille**: For me, singing in Toronto is like singing for my family - it is simultaneously the most comforting and the most terrifying place to perform! You always want to do well for those you love, and I love this city and the musicians and audiences in it. I \"grew up\" as a musician here. I sang my first year undergrad recital in Mazzoleni Hall where we will be performing on the 12th. In fact, I sang _Shepherd on the Rock_ for the first time on that stage in 2005 - almost ten years ago exactly! I have grown and changed so much as a singer and as a person since then and am acutely aware that Toronto has seen me grow and change… and so I always want to make her, and her audiences, proud.",

        "body": "<h2>Ambiguous Upbeats</h2>\n<p>\n\tI'd say, as a general observation, that approximately one in ten upbeats given is ambiguous. The conductor isn't trying to be a jerk, or psych out the pianist; ambiguous upbeats are some of the joys of making music with human beings. What do I mean by ambiguous? Often the upbeat is <em>so slow</em> that the huge container of space between upbeat and downbeat becomes an abyss-like void in which I forget to subdivide. Or, the upbeat is so quick that it's basically imaginary. Lingering upbeats, too, those are tricky; they start with a really decisive tempo, and just as the maestro's hand looks ready to flick towards a downbeat, it gets wishy-washy, like the rhythmic equivalent of forgetting what you were <em>just</em> about to say. Those ambiguous downbeats get weirder when the pianist misses the cue, and then there's a shared moment of wide-eyed wonder between conductor and pianist, both baffled by their miscommunication.\n</p>\n<h2>When the director asks, \"Can you just play me that music?\"</h2>\n<p>\n\tGood opera directors use the music as well as the text. In rehearsal, sometimes demonstration is the best method to communicate a director's vision to the singers. When a director asks something like, \"can I just hear that music?\" a weird phenomenon happens. All of a sudden, the pianist is in the spotlight, which is something we all sort of agree to avoid. Plus, when the director is demonstrating his use of said music, I get insanely curious as to what he's going to do. Now I'm playing \"that music\" with a much-too-attentive audience listening, while being totally distracted from my score because I'm trying to sneak side glances at what's being done during said music. Is he going to do a little dance? Stab someone? Steal their hat? It could be anything, and so I'm super interested. It means my heart is in the right place, but my sudden and inexplicable decline in pianistic skills garners some weird glances from the maestro. Sorry, maestro.\n</p>\n<h2>Filling in for absentee singers</h2>\n<p>\n\tSometimes a scene is staged during a rehearsal to which not all of the singers are called. They may be sick, unavailable, or not necessary to the goal of the current rehearsal. One of the jobs of the pianist (and often the conductor) is to sing the missing vocal lines in order to keep the rehearsal going smoothly. This is weird. It's weird because pianists are rarely singers, and their untrained, octave-lower voices are often hilariously hideous in comparison to the professional voices in the room. Even weirder, is when the conductor takes on this job. For the most part, I'm more than happy to cede the singing to an eager conductor, even if my voice is <em>marginally</em> more beautiful. On a couple of weird occasions, the conductor and pianist will fill in the <em>multiple</em> roles that aren't being sung by the proper folks. All of a sudden, there's an awkward, multi-tasking, yelling match in the guise of a duet happening between two non-singers. Totally weird, and I'm sure everyone in the room is suppressing laughter. I know I would, if singers took over for me at the keys with a combination of keyboard-mashing and air piano.\n</p>\n<h2>The drifting director</h2>\n<p>\n\tThere's an unspoken rule that the line of sight between pianist and conductor should remain unsullied. When I was just starting out playing opera rehearsals, there was a sickening panic in my gut every time someone (meaning no harm) wanders close to that sight-line. It still happens, although it's a reaction similar to when I'm walking on the sidewalk, impatiently trying to scuttle around slow walkers. <em>Mooooooove</em>. The weird part comes when the culprit is the director. Often the director will be watching a scene unfold, and he or she will mindlessly drift into the conductor-pianist sight-line, and it's not kosher to snap at the director for doing so. It's his rehearsal, after all. The director usually intersects the sight-line perpendicularly, by drifting forwards or back wards slightly, settling on a spot that's <em>just</em> in the way. When I see out of the corner of my eye that this may indeed happen, I attempt to stop it telepathically. <em>Oh no, he's moving forward. O</em><em>h God not now, this is terrible timing, there's so much rubato happening. I really need to see. Please stop moving forward. You're still moving...ok keep moving then, keeping moving and then I can see again. Oh no, you've stopped. </em>Often the conductor doesn't realize this is all happening, since it's not his job to look at the pianist. He does look up, though, when he's wondering what's happening with the music and why the pianist has suddenly gone rogue. The weirdest part? Deciding between taking the blame for the music blunder, or pointing the finger at the director. Yikes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat weirdness have you seen in rehearsal?

The piece is based on the true story of Douglas Engelbart's demonstration of new technology in 1968, in which he introduced the idea of hypertext and even the very first mouse. Engelbart led the demonstration remotely from his office 30 miles away, via videoconferencing and screen-sharing, two more <em>huge</em> steps forward in technology. The presentation became aptly known as \"the mother of all demos.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn their electronic opera, <em>The Demo</em>, Engelbart is played by Rouse, and Neill plays William English, Engelbart's technical assistant. They use the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY\">full 100-minute video</a> from that conference in 1968, and \"the typed text of the original demo serves as the libretto for the vocals, performed by Rouse and others, the technical jargon as opera supertitles.\" This text included things like grocery lists and fragments of code.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt looks like a cool way of telling a fascinating story, one that may be a generation too old for many of us, but undoubtedly has relevance today.

        "body": "I came across this BBC [article](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20141222-the-worlds-first-supermodel) about Evelyn Nesbit, who was one of the first supermodels at the turn of the 20th century. She was just 14 years old when she began her modelling career, posing artists on the streets of Philadelphia, who favoured her as their muse for paintings and sketches. After she moved with her mother to New York City in 1900, Evelyn quickly became one of America's most sought-after models. She was on the covers of _Vanity Fair_, _Ladies' Home Journal_,_ Harper's Bazaar_, and _Cosmopolitan, _and posed for ads for Coca-Cola; she was even a chorus girl on Broadway. \n\nAs you'd expect from a teenaged fashion model, Evelyn had no shortage of interested, rich men. One of them was Stanford White, an architect 30 years her senior, who made a lasting impression with things like red velvet swings and \"mirror rooms.\" Evelyn was 15 years old, Stanford was 47\\. Another of her suitors was millionaire Harry Kendall Thaw, who somehow convinced Evelyn to marry him in 1905, after spending years beating her and chastising her for not being a virgin. In June of 1906, on the roof of Madison Square Garden, Thaw shot White three times, killing him. Evelyn was tied up in what became known as \"The Trial of the Century,\" in which the media was treated to gruesome details about White's murder, and the complicated web of jealous husbands and ex-lovers. \n\nThis story of a love-triangle-gone-murder has all the stuff of good drama, no doubt; in fact, the story was turned into a film by Richard Fleischer in 1955, called _The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing_. I couldn't help but think to myself, jeez, Evelyn's story ould make a _great_ opera. The way-too-young pin-up girl who grows up fast in New York City; the wealthy and manipulative men around her; the murder that happens atop Madison Square Garden, right after a show. Plus, there would be more than enough excuses to squeeze a little ragtime into the score. The operatic version of this story could resemble a mash-up of _Manon_ and _Lulu_, but set in New York. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428714246856/GibsonGirlsBeach.jpg)\n<figcaption>Gibson Girls on the Beach. By Charles Dana Gibson</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nEven more fascinating was the trail of clicks that led beyond my interest in Evelyn Nesbit. Evelyn's résumé included her status as a Gibson Girl, the illustrated feminine ideal, from the mind of artist [Charles Dana Gibson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dana_Gibson) in the 1890s. Evelyn was one of several models of the Gibson Girl image, which included a towering, bouffant hairstyle, a \"sporty jaw,\" and a wasp waist. The Gibson Girl was considered one of the first big fashion crazes in the United States, representing \"thousands of American women.\"  \n\nLooking at Gibson's illustrations, it struck me that he was one of those artists who really did know that women held immense power over men. His work shows Gibson Girl-type women in everyday places, like dinner parties and beaches, almost apathetic over their clear control. This is one of my favourites; it's called _They Are Only Collecting the Usual Fans and Gloves:_ \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428714322515/GibsonIllustration.gif)\n<figcaption>Illustration: Charles Dana Gibson</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWhen we think of fashion trends (and the people who create them), there's a pretty strong association with creating low self-esteem in women. The concept of an \"ideal\" beauty wouldn't go over well on the Internet. But I think it's fascinating that Gibson, the man responsible for one of the very first fashion trends, was so entirely aware of why women should never have low self-esteem; to him, women were fantastically powerful. Gibson's wife, Irene Langhorne Gibson, was a Gibson Girl herself, but she's known more for her political work. She helped found Big Sisters Inc., and demonstrated for the women's suffrage movement. So, the Gibsons were generally pretty great. \n\nAnyway. I think the story, the mythology, even, of the Gibson Girl would make a great opera in itself. The story could speak about women, men, the media, the human urge to follow trends; there's even a story in the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Gibson, whose understanding of social issues seemed ahead of their time. What would the opera sound like? I imagine you could have a neat mix of diegetic and non-diegetic music, as we follow the Gibson Girls in and out of parties and along the streets of New York. I keep thinking of composers like Debussy and Honegger, to go with the misty, almost supernatural feminine archetypes. \n\nThere you have it, opera composers; I've done all the hard work, right?",

I imagine that get's really difficult when you work on stories like <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/the-unsolved-murder-of-leah-anderson-1.3000903\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/the-unsolved-murder-of-leah-anderson-1.3000903\">this one</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2828862/Husband-tells-agony-death-Jehovah-s-Witness-wife-refused-blood-transfusion-C-section.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2828862/Husband-tells-agony-death-Jehovah-s-Witness-wife-refused-blood-transfusion-C-section.html\">this one</a>; of course, the heaviest stories are often the most important to tell.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI bring this up because I saw a familiar parallel between a journalist's struggles to stay emotionally uninvolved, and that of an opera singer performing a role. In all the voice lessons I've audited, one of the major themes is the challenge to do less. In the context of singing, doing less simply frees up more bodily tension, allowing a relaxed sound to come out; an easy, tension-free sound is what singers strive for, not only because it's more comfortable, but because a relaxed voice can pack the most punch for the audience.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the context of drama, doing less allows the audience to feel more. That old chestnut that does something like, \"if you cry, the audience doesn't have to,\" is really accurate. I think the urge that singers feel to \"give it their all,\" or some similar ism, comes from their desire to share with the audience all the things that made <em>them</em> love the role/aria/scene in the first place. The irony is that the performances by Callas and Pavarotti and Te Kanawa that gripped us so tightly, were mostly based in the world of \"doing less.\" Their voice and body, free of superimposed tension and overthought ideas, is entirely enough. Why wouldn't that apply to everyone?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI saw the parallel between the journalist and the singer, and I'm sure there are endless similar examples. But there you have it, some shower thoughts for this sunny Saturday.\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\tThe opera scene in Canada can be divided into two broad groups: those with real estate, and those without. Companies like the <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.coc.ca/\">Canadian Opera Company</a> own the Four Seasons Centre, which they use for their whole season. Other companies, like <a href=\"http://www.operafive.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.operafive.com/\">Opera 5</a>, move between various venues for their shows. There is indeed a blurry line between a company owning its primary performance space, and a company's having a history of regular use in a specific venue, the way <a href=\"http://www.operademontreal.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.operademontreal.com/en\">l'Opéra de Montréal</a> uses space at Place des Arts. Generally speaking, though, larger opera companies have a fixed performance venue, and smaller, independent companies are more nomadic.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy? The obvious reason is that real estate is expensive; even renting a theatre big enough to house the size of productions synonymous with the COC or l'O. de M. can be prohibitively costly for a small company with less revenue. There's also a case to be made for grandeur. I'm always an advocate of up-close theatre, but the need for large-scale, overwhelming productions of Verdi, Wagner, and the likes, is legitimate. But what would happen if Canada's larger opera companies took a portion of their productions out of their main stage?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCompanies like Against the Grain Theatre have already made use of black box theatres, courtyards, and pubs that house compact productions. The repertoire is arguably standard for an opera company (<em>La bohème</em>, <em>The Turn of the Screw</em>, <em>Pelléas et Mélisande</em>), the singers are some of the same voices heard on Canada's largest stages, and the productions are designed to be seen and heard up close. Compare this to a company like the COC, which has a much larger annual budget, and a long history as a major Canadian arts establishment. They too put up arguably standard repertoire with a few unexpected treats, and audiences can count on hearing great singing. The draw for large-scale productions like these is in the famous singers, visually arresting productions, and a general grandeur that comes from sitting in a full-on opera house.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what of the audiences that don't yet have a frame of reference, a context for the different between opera in the Four Seasons Centre and opera in a pub? Since we're always a little bit talking about getting new, younger audiences, I think it may be time to discuss The Opera House. To opera newcomers, the impressive theatres and huge sets may not pack the punch we expect; after all, they have Netflix. I'm not saying these Netflix-loving newbies wouldn't enjoy themselves at the opera, but perhaps the theatres and sets aren't what will seal the deal. What would happen if the artistic calibre, and the larger audiences, of Canada's large companies were combined with the venues of indie opera? Audiences could hear the likes of Jane Archibald and Adrianne Pieczonka, up close, maybe even with a beer in hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSure, not every opera translates well outside of a traditional stage; that goes for different singers, too. Wagner's <em>Ring Cycle</em> would be tricky to do with limited space and orchestra, but I think it falls into the same category as a lot of Romantic opera, which demands plenty of room and plenty of people on and under the stage. That said, perhaps smaller, informal venues for large companies could help the cause for new opera in Canada. So much of Canada's opera is being written on a small scale, in part because it's still in a workshop stage, but often the story simply calls for a more intimate setting. I wonder if projects like<a href=\"http://schmopera.com/in-review-tapestry-briefs-booster-shots/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"/in-review-tapestry-briefs-booster-shots/\"> the short scenes I saw at Tapestry Opera</a> would have an easier time bridging the gap between the workshop stage and a finished production; something like Benton Roark's <em>The Whisky Opera</em> could benefit from getting picked up by a large company with a more flexible budget, without the catch of having to fill a huge theatre. Here's the final icing on the cake: with a smaller venue, companies could hire singers from an entirely different pool. The size of a singer's voice wouldn't matter nearly as much, and the focus would zero right in on finding singers who can act and communicate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHow would my utopian concept play out in reality, I wonder? How much money would be freed up in the budgets of Canada's major opera houses if they weren't spending as much on a large theatre? Would the pool of grant money available to opera companies be spread out a little more evenly? Or would lowering their expenses disqualify these companies from receiving as much grant money, cancelling out any savings? Would the <a href=\"http://www.iatse58.org/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.iatse58.org/\">International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees</a> take issue with an opera company outsourcing a production or two to a smaller theatre that requires less crew members? What happens to these large theatres when they're not being used by the opera?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen companies are asking questions about new audiences and the relevance of opera, and when the scope and scale of even the most stunning productions are easily outmatched by the visual possibilities of film and television, it seems obvious that opera should take another look at what it's always had to offer: live theatre, and real-deal singers. What if the prospective audiences of today simply aren't as taken with the opera houses as we think? The grandness of it all may be outweighed by the ticket price, the insinuated dress code, and the pressure to stay quiet and still in the dark for several hours. The interest in small, nomadic opera companies like Canada's <a href=\"http://bicycleopera.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://bicycleopera.com/\">Bicycle Opera Project</a>, or the UK's <a href=\"http://www.operaupclose.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.operaupclose.com/\">OperaUpClose</a>, tells us that opera still has a monopoly on incredible singers and the power they hold over a live audience. It would be a risk, certainly, but perhaps the way for large companies to find relevance and new audiences is to pack a bag and go visit some of those people in the venues they're already frequenting.\n</p>",

        "body": "<h2>1. Who is Louise?</h2>\n<p>\n\tLouise is the daughter of a working class couple in Paris. She lives in a tenement building with two overly protective parents, a father who adores her but treats her like a precious baby doll and a mother who hits her and shames her. Louise is in love with Julien, a penniless artist and who comes to visit her at her balcony. Julien has written Louise's parents asking for her hand in marriage but they ignore the young couple on the grounds that Louise is their property and Julien is a worthless Bohemian with nothing to offer. Louise, however, is a young woman on the verge of discovering her own power. She has desires and wishes about love and life, she wants to open her heart to the young man she loves and discover a city that calls to her with its energy and its lights. She is not necessarily rebellious, but hungry to discover a life outside of the dress shop in which she spends all her daytime hours and the oppressive environment at home where she is completely controlled by her parents. The point of the drama is the clashes in the heart of Louise between the sentiments of duty and love for her family and her longing for liberty, pleasure, love and adventure. Louise sings, \" I will no longer be the daughter with the timid, fearful heart, but the wife with the heart of flame.\" She is brave and passionate.\n</p>\n<h2>2. What does the opera say about women in Paris in the early 20th century?</h2>\n<p>\n\tThe opera demonstrates that by today's standards it would be almost impossible for a modern woman to not suffocate under the social limits of a working class girl in Paris in the 1900's. You were obligated to be a pawn in your family's welfare or else suffer being cast out and cut off from your loved ones.\n</p>\n<h2>3. How does it feel to sing this role, compared to all the Mozart in your repertoire?</h2>\n<p>\n\tIt's a whole different vehicle. The writing is beautiful and lyrical, but the challenges are that it is very dramatic and the orchestra is HUGE. I sang the famous aria \"Depuis le jour\" at Opéra de Québec's annual gala this past December and standing on the stage with a massive orchestra I realized just how thick the orchestration is. It's a French horn party to which the soprano just happened to be invited. It was an exhilarating experience, but also a reality check. Louise may be a young girl, but vocally you need to think TOSCA!!\n</p>\n<h2>4. Why do you think Louise is so rarely performed in North America?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI think it's a logistical issue mostly. French opera in general is very expensive to produce. <em>Louise</em> has only four main characters, but almost 50 secondary characters, plus a massive orchestra. That's mega bucks and mega production management. However, I believe what makes the opera so special is that it is such a personal creation by Charpentier. It is his only opera, he wrote the libretto as well as the music, and he based the story on his own personal life. Grace Moore, a famous interpreter of the role of Louise, used to work with Charpentier in his apartment in Paris before her role debut at the Opéra Comique in 1929. In her autobiography, she noted that Charpentier explained to her that he himself was Julien and that he and Louise \"had had much happiness, sorrow and visions together. That he had been fortunate indeed to give back in music some of the priceless beauty Louise had given him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLastly, on my own personal note, the title role of this opera is an amazing vehicle for the soprano. It has attracted many divas over the years, most notably the force of nature Mary Garden, who replaced an ailing leading lady at intermission on the 9th performance when it opened in 1900. Grace Moore in turn studied the role intensively with Mary Garden and made the role one of her signature pieces. I think what makes Louise an exciting role to play today is that there is still so much undocumented in terms of recordings, DVD's etc., and so one is obliged to take one's interpretation directly from the score. And because Charpentier was so invested in this title character, he has created beautiful arch in her character dramatically, sweeping lines as she discovers passion and unrelenting dramatic leaps and colors and Louise learns to stand up for her self and claim life on her own terms. It is a very exciting role and I am so pleased to be singing her for the first time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYou can also follow Leslie Ann Bradley on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeslieABradley\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"https://twitter.com/LeslieABradley\">@LeslieABradley</a>.\n</p>",

        "body": "In the English-speaking world of non-English language opera, a surtitlist's work is vital - some wouldn't agree, but every day a surtitlist has to wake up and ignore the haters. Surtitles have had their share of critique from the snob-pera folks (not that I'm against any form of opera, from the purest of the purists to Fat Mike's new \"Home Street Home\") but for many companies, they're essential to the success of a production by providing a more universal accessibility. \n\nI belong to the [Saskatoon Opera](http://www.saskatoonopera.ca/) - we are a small, happy, vibrant company in Saskatchewan, Canada. We put on one lavish mainstage production every summer, and the company is devoted to music education the rest of the year. I usually work a full-time job outside of the company, so the work I do with that year's production takes place in whatever free time I have left. It's what I look forward to every summer. \n\nA surtitlist is their own beast; we are not production, tech, crew, pit or cast, but a little bit of everything. When I began with Saskatoon Opera, it all boiled down to a) knowing the director and head of the board, b) being in university and needing a bit of pocket money, and c) being able to use a computer, read a piano/vocal score and chew gum at the same time. At the time, I had just switched majors from music education to women's studies, and I was eager to keep using my knowledge - I just didn't know it would be in opera! \n\nA day in my life as a surtitlist begins normally: I wake up and complain heartily about waking up, like most sane people. Then I go to work, and come home to write surtitles and work on cueing my score. It's painstaking and a bit tedious, especially when rehearsals begin and the director's notes are full of redirections and cuts, but it has to be done and it has to be done very accurately. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428715187766/MichelleCollage-1024x531.jpg)\n<figcaption>This is what detail-obsessive face looks like in gel lighting.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI attend production meetings and rehearsals as time allows in order to speak with the director and production team about the vision and staging, adjust the translation (does it need to be formal, more thematic, more contemporary, etc.) and discuss the fonts, transitions and actual amount of surtitles needed. For example, some companies will have surtitles up during pages and pages of repetition - I, personally, think it's a waste of time and energy, and I want to give the audience a bit of intellectual credit as well as let the actors see the scene through to the end on their own. A big thing in surtitles is making sure you pace the slides so that the laugh or the reaction comes at the right time - getting the audience engagement is a teamwork exercise.  \n\nWhen it's performance time, I have my own rituals - grab a glass of wine or cup of coffee from the front of house bar, go upstairs to my booth, change into jean shorts and a tank top (because my closest friends in my booth are very hot pot lights) and hang up my dress to change into for the end of the evening. My only companions are the input for the projectors, a music stand, a card table and a chair, and I can see only about ½ of the stage at any given time. This is my trade-off for having a booth to myself to concentrate, away from crew chatter and the airless tech booth. \n\nI began thinking to myself one hectic summer, \"Either my full-time job has to go, or I have to stop doing surtitles.\" That's when the plan hatched - I decided that writing surtitles for the rest of my life would be the cat's pajamas, and it would have to happen. That's when I decided to begin developing a tiered service program - I have a solid background in project and service delivery - and a marketing plan. I want to bring fresh, accessible, thematic titles to opera to help the production's authenticity and the director's vision shine through. I am always happy to use the newest technology necessary - for example, Skyping in to watch a rehearsal is part of the service I want to offer, so that I can give each company my best drafts as fast as possible. It keeps all of the editing and initial slide plotting off the director's plate until the director is ready to review. \n\nCustom surtitle work has to subtly reflect what's happening onstage. Marilyn Gronsdal, who works with the Canadian Opera Company, pointed out to me in email conversation that \"(surtitles) are one of the major sources of communication between the audience and the performance.\" I attend as many rehearsals as possible in order to assist with cueing, any tech work related to the surtitles, and to ensure that what I've put in every single slide looks good with the director's vision and what's happening onstage. If there is a rehearsal after work, I try to cram food in my mouth while I'm driving and get to the theatre so I can review my work as I go. \n\nI write all of my titles fresh for every production - I don't believe in getting anything out of the can, because it feels like cheating, and my company deserves better. Every company deserves better! I've seen some good titles and terrible titles, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that anything they can do, I can do better. I want every slide to look as good as the carefully-crafted sets and costumes. I want them to match the actors' portrayals and support their individual characters. I want to keep opera moving forward and help it stay relevant - it's an art that won't quit \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428715149564/2-Emoji-Carmen.jpg)\n<figcaption>I'm terrified that emoji will eventually put me out of a job.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI want every hour I put into writing, attending rehearsals, conferring with the director and maestro, and the time I spend chatting with the cast, to matter. Every company wants this, but sometimes they're not sure how to make it happen. I am firmly convinced that it's important. You have people dedicated to ensuring that your cast looks right and the orchestra is properly paced, and all of this is added value. It's a thrill to know that the audience is responding.  \n\nIt's time for good service to be accessible and affordable to companies in order to create that added value for their audiences. I believe that any project can be elevated with some care and attention paid to details, and having custom work done for your surtitles is a great way for any company to improve their production quality. \n\nAmen!

During his interview, Lissner was given a pop quiz; he was to listen to a few famous opera clips, and identify the opera and aria. He couldn't. I realize the operatic repertoire is humongous, but Lissner couldn't identify \"Vissi d'arte,\" \"Un bel dì vedremo,\" or \"Pace, pace,\" for goodness' sake. The interview is in French, but you don't need to speak it to get the gist:\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<p>\n\t<iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-lsA6wNrAVE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-lsA6wNrAVE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-lsA6wNrAVE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=31a2d8b5de5447f0b129e81f50af7b5b&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">\n\t</iframe>\n</p>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\tRightly so, Gillett called into question the fact that many \"opera bosses\" aren't musicians. \"Sure, some of them will have worked in opera houses for quite a while, learning the ropes on their way up the greasy pole. But I bet I could count on the fingers of one hand the number of opera directors who are musicians in any shape or form. I've certainly met very few who can actually read a score.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIs this a product of delegation among a large company? Does it have to do with opera's need for business-savvy administration? Someone who can't read music doesn't necessarily lack the great ear that an artistic director needs, but Gillett puts it well: \"Perhaps that isn't an absolute necessity. But then again, I wouldn't dream of applying to captain a cricket team because, the last time I checked, I had absolutely no cricketing skills whatsoever beyond shouting 'Oh, well played!' from time to time.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat do you think? Do musically untrained artistic directors add to the problem of alienation between opera and its audiences? Or are opera companies right to leave arts administration to those who make it their day job, and leave the art to the artists? <a href=\"http://www.sinfinimusic.com/uk/features/blogs/christopher-gillett/why-are-so-many-opera-directors-business-people-not-singers-or-conductors\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.sinfinimusic.com/uk/features/blogs/christopher-gillett/why-are-so-many-opera-directors-business-people-not-singers-or-conductors\">Read the full article here.</a>\n</p>",

        "body": "Well, [Tapestry Opera](https://tapestryopera.com/) did it again. I go and see one of their shows, I come away wanting to tell everyone how they should _run_ to the Distillery District to see it, and I'm stuck to find the words to explain why. Last night was the first of two performances of Tapestry's 2nd annual _Tap:Ex _(Tapestry Explorations/Experimentations), this time the program is _Tables Turned_, featuring the music of Montréal-based composer and turn table artist [Nicole Lizée](http://www.nicolelizee.com/), with percussionist [Ben Reimer](https://twitter.com/bnreimer) and the spectacular soprano [Carla Huhtanen](http://www.carlahuhtanen.com/). Lizée's music was in two parts, the first nodding heavily towards iconic films and filmmakers, like Alfred Hitchcock's _The Birds_ and Stanley Kubrick's _The Shining_. The second half was centred on Maria Callas, and the roles of icons in the lives of aspiring artists. \n\nIt was a jarring effect at first, to hear acoustic and electronic instruments, but Lizée uses each respective sound world in an organic way. In this first set, entitled _The Criterion Collection_, Lizée pieces together clips of music and film, and isolates small moments using glitch loops, and deconstructs the audio and video. In the first set, Carla is seen in comfy clothes, sitting down to watch her favourite movies. Lizée focuses on a word or a physical gesture in the film, repeating it over and over at different speeds. Small moments from _The Shining_, \"Come play with us, Danny,\" and Danny's facial expressions, are slowed down and pulled apart. Lizée even adds the image of herself, sitting beside Doris Day at the piano in _The Man Who Knew Too Much_. The last section of _The Criterion Collection_ is made up of moments from _The Sound Of Music_, like when the kids' new stepmother-to-be plays ball with them (\"Baroness Plays Ball\"), when Maria teaches the kids the do-re-mi song (\"Solfège 101\"), when they all get caught singing and dancing about their favourite things (\"Dog Bites Canticle\"), and the singing of the nuns (\"A Clowder of Nuns\"). What Lizée does with the nuns' music was pretty extraordinary, one of my favourite moments from the set. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428716148607/CarlaH.jpg)\n<figcaption>Soprano Carla Huhtanen.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI found Lizée's work fascinating to watch and listen to, and Carla's part in this set helped connect Lizée's music to the motivation behind its creation. I heard Lizée as someone near my age, who grew up watching a lot of the same movies as I did; just like me, Lizée had her favourite moments of all time in those movies, and she was almost embodied in Carla's movie-loving character. When those favourite moments were shared, like when the Baroness winces, thinking she's going to get hit with the ball, I really did feel like I had something in common with all the art in the room. I wasn't the only one who felt included with this nod to a shared culture. I heard people reacting all around me, nervously laughing when those twins from _The Shining_ appeared onstage. With this program, I finally understood the level of cultural relevance that Tapestry's Artistic Director [Michael Mori](https://tapestryopera.com/about/who-we-are/) calls for in today's opera scene. To have people in the audience, reacting vocally to what they see and hear, and empathizing with the Carla's live character in front of us, is a simple and profound moment of relevance for which most opera houses strive.  \n\nThe second set, entitled _La Callas Fantasie_, featured Carla more prominently. She plays a singer, one of the many opera singers that idolizes Maria Callas. Over the piece, we see Carla practicing her difficult arias, struggling with coloratura and sound quality, and trying to emulate La Divina. Lizée uses a few quintessential arias recorded by Callas, to punctuate a singer's journey of frustration and self-doubt and over-analysis, trying to find her own voice. Carla sang fragmented, frustrated bits of that tricky coloratura in \"Non più mesta\" from _La Cenerentola_, which Lizée splits up between the voices of Carla and Callas. Lizée does the same, in longer, more desperate-sounding fragments of \"Una voce poco fa\" from _Il barbiere di Siviglia_. I thought it was a perfect capturing of an artist whose progress is stunted by the unrealistic, overbearing presence of their idol. Carla went from determined, to frustrated, to trying to be someone she's not. At this point, Lizée introduces clips from [interviews Maria Callas gave with Lord Harewood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM78P3wtqII); Lizée continues to deconstruct and isolate certain words Callas says, like \"recitativo\", and \"Bellini is very different than Donizetti,\" and \"I am not an idol, I am human.\" From this point, Carla's character gathers confidence, with Callas' recording of the Habanera from _Carmen_; I like to think Lizée was telling artists that their idols are important, but they don't signify a \"right path to success.\" Carla's final notes of _La Callas Fantasie _were full and rich and satisfying, and she sang with a sound that was reserved for when her character finds her _own voice_. I kept thinking of the term, \"swan song\", but she wasn't dying. I loved that an artist used other artists to tell even more artists that they are truly artists. \n\nSo, when I say I don't know how to describe what happened, it's because a lot of it was new to me. I don't trust my turntable terminology, for one, but my lack of descriptors comes from the fact that Nicole and Carla made great art that demanded a reaction from the audience. _Tables Turned _was good art by great artists, and as complicated as it probably was, the over-arching cultural references weren't hard for the audience to grasp. Seems like a simple recipe for good theatre, and it was.

        "body": "<p>\n\tOpera has this air about it that screams, \"I am grand! I am big and loud! I am epic and serious!\" Even comic opera has a dignified energy about it, and the singers onstage have no choice but to command the audience's attention. A similar idea exists about the people who make opera, like the spotlight-loving singers, the excitable directors, the magnetic conductors. They're all larger-than-life, and people like Jessye Norman, Carlos Kleiber, and Christopher Alden are examples of opera's extrovert personality.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last time I attended a COC event to cover an upcoming show, it occurred to me how lucky I was to have found not one, but two ways of involving myself in opera without having to absorb much of the attention. I'm an introverted person, and I think it's one of the reasons I was so drawn to being an opera coach and répétiteur. I could witness every single rehearsal, work with the singers and put a bit of my own musical aesthetic into the show, and then stand back and watch it all happen. Since I've started Schmopera.com, I've been able to sit in on even more rehearsals, ask questions of the creative staff, and show all the fascinating backstage stuff to readers. On top of it all, I still get to see the show.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tActually, opera is a fantastic industry in which to be an introvert. Those flashy singers are a small proportion of the team of people it takes to put up an opera. Assuming people fit into two broad groups, extroverts and introverts, I'd put most of the coaches, stage managers, designers, and orchestra musicians into the latter group. It's not even that hard to think of a few opera directors and conductors that are really introverts at heart. Of course, not every opera singer needs everyone's attention all the time, but part of their skill is the ability to turn on that side of them while at work. Not everyone can do that, and lots of those people are working behind the scenes of an opera, doing jobs that are pretty cool in their own right.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDesigners get to create costumes, sets, lighting, all without setting foot onstage, and music staff get to do most of their fun work before opening night. Stage managers get to cue entire shows, all while backstage, dressed in black, because they have to stay invisible, inaudible, and unobtrusive. Doesn't that sound amazing? I may be wrong, but I doubt that the majority of people who work behind the scenes of opera actually wish they could step onstage and take a bow.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I've done opera school tours, they include Q&amp;A sessions where the students can ask us questions. Inevitably, the questions lead to some permutation of, \"Can I do opera, too?\" It's a perfect chance to talk about becoming a singer, but myself and our stage manager also get a chance to speak up about our roles in creating opera. I'm not one to discourage budding singers, but I assume I wasn't the only quiet, shy kid in elementary school; those shy kids might love the idea of working backstage in theatre.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider all that grandness, the next time you go and see an opera, and how it is so often born not out of flashy, loud folks, but out of the minds of quiet, thoughtful people. Shy pianists, designers, organized people, the opera probably needs you all.\n</p>",

I didn't know the piece, but I immediately remembered how Offenbach is like French Rossini, with more romanticism and unexpectedly beautiful melodies. <em>La belle Hélène </em>is an <em>opera-bouffe</em> take on the Greek myth of Paris and his abduction of Helen, directed by <a href=\"http://www.joelivany.com/index/welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.joelivany.com/index/welcome.html\">Joel Ivany</a> with choreography by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennemethod\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"https://twitter.com/jennemethod\">Jennifer Nichols</a>, and conducted by Uri Mayer. The cast and chorus did an admirable job with all of the dancing, and I thought the work by Jennifer and Joel were really complementary.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe show was sung in French, with English dialogue by Michael Albano. I don't know the original dialogue for \n\t<em>La belle Hélène</em>, but it was clear that Albano had fun with the translation, updated the language, and included a few timely jokes (\"John Tory's Smart Track!\"). The dialogue was absolutely in line with Joel's idea of the production, which was one that acknowledged and had fun with all the silly plot holes and melodramatic music that comes with most operetta. The minimal sets by Camellia Koo and costumes by Ming Wong put the setting largely in an Ancient Greek period, but Joel wasted no time breaking the concept of time and place. For her first aria, Hélène is supplied (by <a href=\"http://schmopera.com/author/greg/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"/author/greg/\">Gregory Finney</a> as chorus/stage hand, of course) with a microphone and a spotlight, and she sings downstage, cabaret-style. I was glad that Joel went with this stand-alone aria, letting it be a song for its own sake. There were gags with the orchestra, like the \"bad clarinetist\" who couldn't seem to get it right (handled hilariously by Daniel Wheeler as Menelaus). Between the moments of exaggerated comedy, and some breaking of the fourth wall, I thought this was a great take on a piece that has a fair amount of dramatic fluff. Plus, everyone onstage was having fun.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428716647175/La-Belle-Helene-289-2.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ETP_9UCTOmLHFSMWW4fxdPXpWLc2vRVjA_1dFyIqge6Thfk7v1CisUTWx-B4cUUGm1xMuuy8-whdJeiHY4qRnyqC2ZwUvw\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ETP_9UCTOmLHFSMWW4fxdPXpWLc2vRVjA_1dFyIqge6Thfk7v1CisUTWx-B4cUUGm1xMuuy8-whdJeiHY4qRnyqC2ZwUvw=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Christina Campsall and Asitha Tennekoon.

Helen of Troy was The Most Beautiful Woman in the World, and I liked how Christina's Hélène was quite aware of her own beauty. Also aware of his hotness was Hélène's lover Paris, sung by tenor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asten8r\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"https://twitter.com/asten8r\">Asitha Tennekoon</a>. He had an exciting, focused tenor sound, and had plenty of personality to boot. He managed to play a cocky wife-napper, while still being liked by the audience. Asitha is definitely one to watch; you can catch him as Bénédict in <a href=\"http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/201415-season/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/201415-season/\">Metro Youth Opera's <i>Béatrice et Bénédict</i></a>, opening April 24. was a great energy onstage, a cocky character still liked by the audience. As Oreste, Nadine Anyan had great trouser-role energy. In <em>La belle Hélène</em>, Oreste is a spoiled son, entitled to prostitutes and gambling all day long. Nadine was covered at times by the orchestra, and I wondered if the role really showed what she can do.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428716610851/La-Belle-Helene-410.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yi5F_GRjB1sOTFWoSn4O-sd32jFu6qJcwIdyMujpnpnrvP1H8qRbrluaEpV4YrhDX3ODOBHh62bcpqTOcIwq3QTM6e3O\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yi5F_GRjB1sOTFWoSn4O-sd32jFu6qJcwIdyMujpnpnrvP1H8qRbrluaEpV4YrhDX3ODOBHh62bcpqTOcIwq3QTM6e3O=s1200\"></a><figcaption>l-r: Ronan MacParland, Daniel Wheeler, Tristan Jones. Photo: Stuart Lowe\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tTristan Jones was great as Agamemnon, singing the role with a humongous, bright sound. Agamemnon has some of the most difficult music of the show, with lots of patter and parts that go unnecessarily high; Tristan made it seem easy. As Ménélas, Hélène's husband, Daniel Wheeler was a cartoon-like version of a cuckolded king; I'm fairly sure Daniel has experience in music theatre, and it showed in his physicality onstage. As Calchas, the double agent who secretly works for Hélène, Ronan MacParland was more comedy, rounding out the pattering, Stooge-like trio of men. He had a fantastic speaking voice in the dialogue, but I tended to lose him when he sang. I loved the cameos by Achille and Ajax I and II, sung by Christopher Wattam, Justin Stolz and Alvaro Vasquez Robles, respectively. The Tweedledee and Tweedledum schtick with the two Ajaxes was pretty cute.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428716506105/La-Belle-Helene-066-2.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TVAqllmJwOWqj47TNPCztNfbhaD8P7bKWwhLasiJejQBuHmDjNtARcMo37z1c6G_0bu96Cau36mk3bSz6fGIP2mUqxrk\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TVAqllmJwOWqj47TNPCztNfbhaD8P7bKWwhLasiJejQBuHmDjNtARcMo37z1c6G_0bu96Cau36mk3bSz6fGIP2mUqxrk=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Members of the chorus of the GGS Opera production of La belle Hélène. Photo: Stuart Lowe.\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tThe chorus had a tight sound, and I have to give them many, many kudos for their dance work with Jennifer Nichols. The chorus included baritone and Schmopera contributor Gregory Finney. The orchestra, under the baton of Uri Mayer, had a great palate of sound. I though Mayer micro-managed some of the operetta rubato, but the style was there and the orchestra had some truly beautiful moments. I noticed that the orchestra covered several of the singers in the ensemble numbers, but this was the first opera I'd seen (yes, first!) in Koerner Hall, and it may be a regular acoustic issue.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a piece, I think \n\t<em>La belle Hélène</em> has some loose ends, both dramatically and musically. On the other hand, some of the music was brilliantly hilarious; the \"l'homme à la pomme\" scene was one of my favourites. There's a scene where everyone is making Ménélas go to Crete so that Hélène and Paris can get to know each other; I thought of Rossini again, specifically of the whole Act II finale with Basilio, \"Buona sera,\" etc. Just like Joel, Jennifer Nichols took the more cheesy moments in stride, including wing-flapping choreography for the goose scene. Plot holes and silliness aside, it was hard to not have fun with this show.\n</p>",

        "body": "Happy St. Patrick's Day, everyone! To give an operatic nod to the patron saint of Ireland, here are some appropriately-themed clips via YouTube. First up is Irish tenor [John McCormack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCormack_(tenor)) (1884-1945), who had a pretty enviable career; he sang at Covent Garden, Royal Albert Hall, made tons of recordings. He [apparently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCormack_(tenor)) had such great breath control that he could sing 64 notes in a row of Mozart's \"Il mio tesoro\" without taking a breath (that's a weird way of putting it, but that's [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCormack_(tenor)) for you). So, here's John McCormack singing \"Il mio tesoro\".\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n\t<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSHnxlf2DPs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nIrish mezzo-soprano Tara Erraught made [headlines last summe](http://schmopera.com/when-critics-are-jerks/)r during her run as Octavian in _Der Rosenkavalier_ at Glyndebourne, when critics (mostly male) made some pretty awful and unnecessary comments about her physique, and her credibility as a male love interest. Mean critics aside, Tara sounds _fantastic_ in this rendition of \"Una voce poco fa\" from _Il barbiere di Siviglia_. Big round sound, lots of agility, personality to boot. Enjoy.</p>\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XPquOVVEwws\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nFor a more vague nod to St. Patrick, here's a clip from Robert Carsen's production of _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ by Britten. It's Oberon's fantastic Act I scene, \"I know a bank\". This clip is not only beautiful, but it's also _particularly_ _green_.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7m-mmnV4VQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nFinally, because sometimes alcohol is involved with St. Paddy's day, I figured a drinking song is in order. Here's a clip from [Otto Schenk's production of _Die Fledermaus_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0260906/), filmed as a TV movie in 1972\\. It's pretty hilarious and the cast is stellar; I beg you all, watch until the 2:30 mark, and you won't be sorry. Watch the whole thing [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY2Mw0LMz-E), because it includes a cameo by Schenk as Frosch. Pretty great.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3mVm_saMyA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nBonus, because it's beautiful: Aprile Millo singing \"Danny Boy.\"\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n\t<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2WSDedhvCKY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nHappy St. Patrick's Day!

        "body": "## 1\\. A soprano and a turntablist are an unlikely pair to share a stage; what brought you together for this project?\n\n**Nicole**: \"Michael [Mori] brought us together. And I had met Carla after a show about a year ago and knew I wanted to work with her. I'm not sure that we're really an 'unlikely pair'. I can anticipate my practice of melding turntablism, electronica, glitch, with 'classical' and 'concert' music extending into the world of opera. And Carla is a perfect collaborator – amazing chops, dynamic, forward thinking, great ideas. We both come from the classical tradition while loving and working in the experimental art scene.\" \n\n**Carla**: \"I've always loved [Nicole's] music. I approached her and asked her if she'd written a lot for the voice, and she admitted that she hadn't. I basically asked her to consider writing something with me in mind. I thought that it was about high time that she got writing for the voice, considering that she has a really good ear for timbre and sound colour.\" \n\n**Michael**: \"[Nicole's music is] not popular or generic in any way; I don't know anyone else who has that kind of a voice. So instantly I'm thinking, 'Ok, how can we bring Nicole into the opera world?' because I think it's something that we need desperately, a fresh look at popular art forms.\" \n\n## 2\\. What has it been like to work together with such different professional backgrounds?\n\n**Carla**: \"Yeah, I'm learning a lot about her process, I guess? I'm learning a lot about, let's say, electronic timing, for lack of a better word. She gives me notes, she gives me scores, but actually have trouble matching up the score with the video and the audio, because I can tell that's not the way she's composing. She'll have bars that switch from 3/16 to 8/16 to 9/16, and I'm like, this doesn't make sense, if I could just figure out a click track or something! So, I found I could learn it better by just listening and watching the video. \n\n\"It gives you a surprising amount of freedom when you're used to being stuck to a piano and a score, and I like it because it gets you off the page right away. It calls for a different type of learning…it's like improvisation.\" \n\n**Nicole**: \"It's been great. But we do share a lot of interests – and actually share some background, coming from the classical and new music worlds. And we both want to see opera and classical music forge ahead, experiment, and remain vital.\" \n\n**Carla**: And our percussionist, don't forget that. [Ben Reimer](http://music.cbc.ca/#!/artists/Ben-Reimer) plays the drumkit and various percussion instruments, and he's so talented, and he knows Nicole very well, he's worked with her for a long time. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428719219823/NicoleLizee-pc-ChrisHutcheson.jpg)\n<figcaption>Nicole Lizée. Photo: Chris Hutcheson</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## 3\\. Why have you included video footage of icons like Alfred Hitchcock and Maria Callas?  \n\n**Nicole**: \"The pieces include both audio and video footage as starting points for new pieces. The new Callas work and my previous work The Criterion Collection are based on glitch that delve into the worlds of certain icons, films and filmmakers that have made a marked impact on my aesthetic. Each work is constructed around damaged and deconstructed audio and video – chewed and warped videocassettes. The resulting errors and imperfections are woven together to create a sonic landscape over which accompanying instrumental material – itself emulating the traits of broken or malfunctioning media – is performed live. \n\n\"The relationship between the live performer and the icon is important. The living performer interacts with the lost, forgotten or even dead icon, simultaneously breathing new life and emotion into the characters while bending, stretching, and hacking the original context, function and storyline. The performer infiltrates the scene and engages with the character; at once becoming part of the mise-en-scène, while simultaneously guiding it into a new direction.\" \n\n**Michael**: \"What was sort of, we'd been wondering what ties this show together, and really I think it's the idea of taking on icons. We look up to these people, and they sort of set the standard of beauty for us with these iconic shows. [Nicole] is not afraid of taking on a \"legend\", and seeing how she could find inspiration.\" \n\n**Nicole**: \"Ultimately I treat the source material as a musical instrument – as part of the ensemble. It is a very specific colour or timbre – not unlike a violin or any member of the orchestra – that has its own distinctive sound or appearance. I want to use that sound like I would any other instrument and integrate it into a chamber work.\" \n\n## 4\\. What do you think _Tap:Ex Tables Turned_ has to do with today's opera scene?\n\n**Nicole**: Opera had at one time been about reflecting the 'now' – both sonically and conceptually – and I think there's a place for stories to be told that reference our generation and encapsulate the wide array of sounds and images therein. I grew up in the '70s and '80s (and even the '90s – there was possibly some growing up done in University). This was the age of rapid technological advancements – uniquely straddling both analogue and digital. Music and art were experimental and many disparate genres were born. Counterculture was important and had a following. I was obsessed with all of this while simultaneously being obsessed with classical music. What happens when worlds merge? New stories, sounds, visions, ideas, etc. There's room in classical music and opera for ideas and devices that very much exist and mean something to a lot of people: electronic instruments, hi-hats, glitch, grooves, sampling, iconography, etc. My formative years were filled with both so it feels very natural for these worlds to coexist. \n\n**Michael**: \"Sometimes you have to view [projects like] this as production development, for a product. A company like Apple, when they come out with a new product, they want to test it, they want to put it out there and see how people's reactions are. This is certainly a time when we want to take more risks, and try some things that are more bold. \n\n\"The significance of Nicole's music is that her electronic music is based on acoustic recordings. As opposed to being completely electronically-generated sounds, what she's doing is capturing and twisting and deconstructing and reconstructing and making new music out of bits of things that were once ours. I think the cool balance with Nicole is that the sound effect is electronic, but it has come from live recording. \n\nThe way she deconstructs things and messes with them, there's so much potential there…that is opera, having connections with other art forms.\" \n\n**Carla**: \"You get an emotional reaction from it. You can hear what [Nicole] is doing and how she's creating it, and there's a really clear effect emotionally, it's really of inescapable. Good opera does that, using sound, or whatever technique it has. You will feel a certain way, and you'll certainly walk away with very good conversations to have at the bar afterwards.",

Anyone who owns books like Pierre Bernac's <em>The Interpretation of French Song</em>, or the Ricci <em>Variations, Cadenzas and Traditions for Singing,</em> knows what I mean. Singers read Bernac for their French rep, the <em>Fischer-Dieskau Book of Lieder</em> for their German, and consult Ricci for ornaments and cadenzas in Italian opera. If it's not authority, it's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition\">Tradition</a>, meaning that because singers have <em>always</em> sung a <em>subito pianissimo</em> on that note, it must be the right thing to do. It's not necessarily that singers can't imagine any of these things for themselves, but it's true that they could get criticized (and perhaps not re-hired) if they don't appeal to biggies like Bernac and Ricci and the Historically Informed Performance scene. Interestingly, people like Ricci and Bernac have become seen as authorities because of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition\">Appeal to Tradition</a> logical fallacy.\n</p>\n<h2>Appealing to Popularity</h2>\n<p>\n\t\"You have to do that portamento! Everyone does that portamento!\" says the hypothetical voice teacher with a specific recording in his head. Appealing to popularity just means that you're arguing something is true because a lot of people think it's true. Or, in the musician's case: because lots of people sing it that way, it must be the <em>right</em> way. I do this, teachers do this, singers do this. Sometimes a method is popular because it's an explicit demand (i.e., a portamento is written into the score by the composer); in that case, the fact that it's popular is irrelevant. Sometimes, it's just because everyone loved them a Callas portamento (myself included!). It doesn't mean that portamento shouldn't be there, but \"because so many people do it\" is a terrible reason to do anything.\n</p>\n<h2>Confirmation Bias and Arguments from Ignorance</h2>\n<p>\n\tOpera directors, coaches, conductors, singers, really anyone whose job it is to interpret music, can be easily accused of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">confirmation bias</a>. This means that you start with a hypothesis, and then interpret the information in front of you to support said existing hypothesis. It's not a reasonable way to look at information, since it usually suggests that you want to prove your own hunch, rather than find the true answer to your question. As a coach myself, I can attest to how easy it is to find different facets of a character written into the music. Confirmation bias in opera, you could argue, is the vehicle behind many directors' choices in boundary-pushing, that's-a-stretch-type productions. This kind of thing reminds me of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance\">Argument from Ignorance</a>, which would go something like, \"well, Da Ponte never says that Donna Elvira <em>isn't</em> married to Don Giovanni.\"\n</p>\n<h2>The Historian's Fallacy</h2>\n<p>\n\tThis one is tricky. Take a piece of music that is centuries old, old enough to come from another time and place, where society worked in an arguably different way. The fallacy comes when we look at this old music anachronistically, assuming that the composer, librettist, singers, even the characters themselves, behaved and thought the way we do today. This is a really interesting one, because it largely concerns intent, both musical and dramatic. On the musical side, we often make assumptions about what a composer \"meant\", like whether or not the Vienna ending of <em>Don Giovanni</em> is tongue-in-cheek. Dramatically, a character like Lucia di Lammermoor is pretty weak and subordinate by today's standards, but a good director knows that Donizetti's opera is a product of the year 1835. Trickier still are characters like Figaro in <em>Il barbiere di Siviglia</em> and Susanna in <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>; they're firecrackers, sure, but still the help. It's a tricky line to toe without really being able to understand the 18th century class system, and, frankly, Beaumarchais. The risk of anachronistic characterization is high, but it's simply a necessary part of the job.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI know, I know, I've sucked all the fun out of music and its subjectivity. I'm not saying music or musicians <em>should</em> adhere to the rules of logic and reason when they make their decisions. In the above cases, there really is no better way of discerning what a composer intended, and there are arguments to be made for stylistic choices that are separate from \"it's in the Ricci book\", or \"Joan Sutherland did it\". I just think it's fascinating that music, as part of the huge world of The Arts, is so ubiquitous <em>and</em> so illogical. I'm a logic lover myself; I find it handy in the real world, outside the rehearsal room. As much as I often want to bring it to work, too, sticking to my reasonable guns would decimate the opportunities for creativity. I hope you all find it amusing as I, though, that there's actually some definitive proof that musicians are, at least a little bit, artsy-fartsy?\n</p>",

        "body": "<h2>1. Why do you think there's such a strong relationship between science fiction and epic, symphonic music?</h2>\n<p>\n\tFilm music plays an exceptionally important part in setting the emotional tone of a film, and creates a psychological direction for the viewer to follow. It seems that science fiction has long appealed to an audience which feels that they are in their own special world (which is a good thing!). To have epic, sweeping, massive music accompany this drama really empowers the viewer. Too often sci-fi fans feel that they are ostracized or in a small minority. Perhaps they were not in the \"in-crowd,\" but when Michael Giacchino, or John Williams, or Howard Shore, or Hans Zimmer, or Jerry Goldsmith creates such a powerful environment for the viewer (or listener), this individual somehow feels more valued, or appreciated or legitimized, plus it increases their own self-confidence. They walk out of the theater with their head held high, shoulders back and say, \"wow that was AWESOME.\" Don't forget when it comes to film music, goose bumps and tears are NOT optional!\n</p>\n<h2>2. How much do you think original film scores (<em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Stargate</em>, etc.) look back to people like Strauss and Wagner?</h2>\n<p>\n\tNo composer today lives in a vacuum. All composers exist in a washing machine of aural experiences. Whether they hear hip hop and rap in the subway, or pop songs playing as background noise in a restaurant (I say noise, because people are not REALLY listening...), composers of today absolutely are influenced by composers from throughout history. I would point to Carl Orff and Gustav Holst as big influences. Wagner and Richard Strauss, too. What we call operas by Richard Wagner, he actually used the term music drama. I think this is an important distinction. Wagner was really focused on the text that he wrote, which he then accompanied with music. Music in films accompanies the dialogue and the storyline, sometimes in the background (underscoring) or sometimes in the forefront where it's the root cause of those goose bumps and tears!\n</p>\n<dl>\n\t<dt></dt>\n\t<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428719702658/Erik-Ochsner-2012.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/77qVxAolaQijGlTjKC6mOc5S89KttZ7Vc75toaMpgDfHzBLZRwJkldrxEAW-Pm2_eDpXrIU4s39Ag0n946NvnWQMUdQx\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/77qVxAolaQijGlTjKC6mOc5S89KttZ7Vc75toaMpgDfHzBLZRwJkldrxEAW-Pm2_eDpXrIU4s39Ag0n946NvnWQMUdQx=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Conductor Erik Ochsner. Photo: erikochsner.com</figcaption></figure>\n</dl>\n<h2>3. Conversely, how do these original scores maintain the sound of \"classical music\" in today's culture?</h2>\n<p>\n\tIt seems that Hollywood film composers have still stuck to the \"old fashioned orchestra.\" The evocative colors, the sheer volume and strength that can be produced by 300 people in an orchestra and chorus far outweigh that which can be done by electronics or most pop music. There have been times when just the right song is written or selected with perhaps just one singer and a guitar which can bring you to tears, but more often than not, these special \"highlight moments\" go back to the classical orchestra. Whether people know it or not, they are listening to \"classical music\" because of the forces which are performing it. Many schools do not have music education anymore, but I grew up with it, and this classical music is not outdated, it's quite current and contemporary.\n</p>\n<h2>4. Are you a sci-fi fan?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI grew up watching <em>Star Trek</em>, and was not a member of the in-crowd. I found solace in my own little world of classical music and I knew people who found solace in their own world of science fiction. I can't really say that I was a Trekkie, and in fact, I will admit that I resisted the films initially because I was stuck in the series mode! I have gradually really grown to appreciate, enjoy, love and respect the new generation's quasi-homage to the <em>Star Trek</em> series! In school, we read <em>The Hobbit</em>, and later as an audience member I saw the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies in the theaters. I had not read the books, but I had to catch up and rise to the occasion since I was going to be conducting the movies!!\n</p>\n<h2>5. You've done a few multi-media concert events (Disney's Pixar in Concert), and concerts focusing on the music from film and TV culture (Lord of the Rings, etc.). What impact do you think it has on audiences to combine live and recorded art forms?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI grew up being surrounded by music. I was taken to children's concerts (\"Lollipop concerts\") and classical concerts, and also pops concerts. My mentor and close family friend was the great Erich Kunzel. He knew how to entertain, he knew how to relate to audiences, to engage them and share his excitement and enthusiasm for this art. I love doing these concerts and the reception worldwide has been amazing! From a \"Pixar in Concert\" with 10,000 children in the Krakow Arena in Poland, to a \"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring\" with 5,000 audience members sitting on the grass, outside in steamy weather of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to a J.R.R. Tolkien Society autograph session in Tampere, Finland, where a young lady showed me how she had glued hair to her leg to look like a hobbit! (wow!)...... People LOVE film music. I very much believe in \"once in a lifetime experiences,\" and we know from credit card sales at venues that these concerts are bringing in new audiences.. Why? because they love it! Do they come back to hear the classical series of Brahms, Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Mahler, etc.? Maybe, maybe not - but we have touched them. We have moved them. We have entertained them. They HAVE experienced LIVE music, LIVE musicians pouring out their heart and soul, and I believe that even if these audiences only hear a live classical symphony orchestra ONCE, that's still ok - we have touched them, because as Heinrich Heine said \"Where words leave off, music begins!\n</p>",

Ochsner is no stranger to combining popular culture with live music, having conducted concerts featuring music from Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, and Disney's Pixar films. I was eager to ask him about the significance of combining cultural elements of today with the symphonic orchestra of past centuries. "

        "body": "<p>\n\tI loved my time in university. For the first time in my life, I was surrounded with everything I needed to do exactly what I wanted: make music, listen to music, scour libraries for music, nerd out about music. I even found like-minded friends, and our relationships grew out of our mutual love of our work. I still remember those inspiring times, even when I look back with exasperation on the disproportionate amount of training for the amount of payback (financial and otherwise). I've touched before on the topic of outdated curriculum for music students, and how the lack of emphasis on self-management and entrepreneurship puts music grads into trouble in the real world. But consider the savvy music student who really does know how to manage his own business and how to market himself. Consider that this student went to school in the United States, say, where an undergraduate degree can put 20-somethings into 6-figure debt. What are the chances that the student will make enough money to a) pay back their student loans in a reasonable amount of time, and b) have a comfortable life, family included, on top of that?\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">I'm not saying that music degrees are a financial black hole, but they cost either as much or near as much as many science degrees. The disparity begs an unpopular question: is it ethical for universities to charge such similar tuition for a music degree as they do for a science degree?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's not difficult to collect information that proves that most <a href=\"http://work.chron.com/average-salary-musical-education-degree-20711.html\" target=\"_blank\">musicians</a> in <a href=\"http://www.canadianbusiness.com/companies-and-industries/canadas-best-jobs-2013-ranking/\" target=\"_blank\">Canada</a> and in the<a href=\"http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report-2014/majors-that-pay-you-back\" target=\"_blank\">United States</a> are on the low end of the income scale, according to profession. Post-secondary education is expensive across the board, but with an entire generation under the weight of huge student loans, shouldn't there be some consideration of the graduate's income potential when calculating tuition fees? Tuition for the <a href=\"http://www.msmnyc.edu/Admissions/Tuition-Fees\" target=\"_blank\">Manhattan School of Music</a>and <a href=\"http://www.juilliard.edu/apply-audition/tuition-fees-and-expenses\" target=\"_blank\">The Juilliard School</a> are similar, just under $40,000 a year, similar to tuition at <a href=\"http://students.rice.edu/students/Tuition_Fees.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Rice University</a>. <a href=\"http://new.oberlin.edu/conservatory/admissions/finances/usa-students.dot\" target=\"_blank\">Oberlin College Conservatory</a> sits at ~$48,000 for most degrees. In Canada, it's a bit better (including significantly lower tuition in general); the tuition costs for music degrees are about 40% less than engineering at the <a href=\"http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/link/students/fees15/dom_music.htm\" target=\"_blank\">University of Toronto</a> and <a href=\"http://www.registrar.uwo.ca/student_finances/fees_refunds/pdfs%20fee%20schedule%20/Fall%20Winter%202014-2015%20UGRD%20fee%20schedule%20CDN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Western University</a>, but a music undergrad will still pay about the same as most science undergrads.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"quote\" class=\"wy-figure-left\">\n<blockquote>\n\t<span rel=\"line-height: 24px;\" style=\"line-height: 24px;\">When there's job insecurity for nurses, teachers, and government works, taking on the added insecurity of a career in the arts could seem a bit masochistic.</span><br>\n\t\n</blockquote>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\tI also know that it comes down to the business of universities. An academic institution has a right to charge their tuition costs, especially if they're privately run. I'm not equipped to argue how these universities use the tuition fees they get from students, and I'm sure that no matter what the cost of education is, we'd all find something to raise an eyebrow at in the universities' financial reports. Neither am I hoping to deter young musicians from pursuing post-secondary education, because these institutions really are where we can find the best education. Likely, there are a few exceptions, some hidden gem-type teachers who work privately. But through a conservatory or a university, students can work with people like Martin Katz, Cesar Ulloa, Warren Jones, Marlena Malas, Michael McMahon, and Marilyn Horne. People of this calibre are objectively great teachers, and they also expose students to their professional circle; this is the golden combination for a student who wants to become a pro.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's also true that musicians aren't the only kind of young professionals hurt by tuition costs (student loans, really). I think young people are aware and outraged about it, and pursuing higher education in music may fall farther down on the list of practical options. When there's job insecurity for nurses, teachers, and government works, taking on the added insecurity of a career in the arts could seem a bit masochistic.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor all I know, these tuition costs are flat-out, no-questions-asked, the real number of dollars it costs to give a student an education; that cost is one of the reasons that artists are always, rightly, pushing for better government funding for the arts. If the price of an education simply can't be lowered, that I think there's at least a responsibility on the administration to create courses for music students that are highly practical and connected with professional circles that matter. Without these things, it's not going to help young people start small businesses (themselves) and start contributing to the real workforce. That, I think, would be unethical.\n</p>",

        "body": "When it comes to conducting a staged work like opera, the distance is probably the most problematic element. \"They can't really hear each other,\" says Dala. \"You're just trying to bring together invisible forces.\" I asked him about working with the two casts of [UofT Opera's _Postcard from Morocco_](http://uoftopera.ca/?page_id=566), and what it's like for him to collaborate with singers in the early stages of their professional careers. \n\n\"I think the main thing is to always just set the bar as high as possible, so that people know what that bar is and that you can accomplish it. I can say, for example, with _Postcard_, it's a very challenging score. It's a very unusual score. I've done a lot of new music, and I love doing it, and there are some pieces that sort of fall into a category or another. I would say that _Postcard_ kind of defies [that]; and I mean musically, it has a certain sensibility, in terms of structure, in terms of the way [Argento] keeps flipping in and out of individual sound worlds to suit the story. It's really quite unlike any other piece that I've ever done. So, the amount of preparation that I'm sure all of these guys did in the fall to get ready for this was huge. So the first day of rehearsals, it was already in quite good shape. And then there are, of course, things to polish. \n\n\"It's absolutely comparable to a professional production. I mean, some of the voices are young, and maybe not as far along as they will be in a few years, and that kind of things. But from the approach, from knowing music, from what they're doing onstage, it's been a fantastic journey in quite a short amount of time.\" \n\nDala has a great understanding of what goes into a young singer's training process. \"For what singers have to do, I have so much respect. Because it's not, you know, just singing, it's _living text_. Last week I went to a couple of the concerts at the TSO, and Barbara Hannigan, for example, was like a masterclass on how to inhibit, how to live inside of a text, and be able to deliver it. It's extraordinary, and that's the kind of thing that I think everybody should aspire to with the repertoire. I went to school with [Barbara] and I remember when she started doing all kinds of premières of everybody's music, and there was a journey there as well. So time and experience and hard work and that kind of devotion to one's craft; it just takes time.\" \n\nToronto is also home for more exciting projects for Dala later this year. In November, he'll conduct the North American première of Philippe Boesmans' opera, [_Julie_](http://www.soundstreams.ca/Julie), presented by [Soundstreams](http://www.soundstreams.ca/Julie). \"The music, it's really intense, almost claustrophobic score.\", says Dala. \"It's a very taut piece, in some ways not unlike _Written on Skin_. In one act, continuous, about 75 minutes long, three characters only, based on Strindberg's [_Miss Julie_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Julie), which in his day was such a revolutionary play.\" \n\nIn setting the _Julie_ libretto by Luc Bondy and Marie-Louise Bischofberger, \"Boesmans really does inhabit his own sound world,\" says Dala. \"I have so much admiration for people who can stare at a blank page and fill it with something. And the more they do it, in certain cases, the really outstanding ones do manage to find, even in this day and age, where it's such a pluralistic society when it comes to music, a way of sounding like themselves and having their own individual voices.\" \n\nAlso with [Soundstreams](http://www.soundstreams.ca/Adrianne-Pieczonka), Dala will conduct their season opening concert in September, featuring the fab singers like Adrianne Pieczonka and Krisztina Szabó. \"Apparently it was one of the first professional gigs \\[Adrienne\\] had when she was graduating…was Soundstreams, back in the late 80s. So it's kind of a homecoming for that piece; I know they're just thrilled that she agreed to do this, and I was very happy that they asked me.\" Adrianne will sing the amazing (amazing!) _Ancient Voices of Children_, by George Crumb, as part of a [juicy-looking programme](http://www.soundstreams.ca/Adrianne-Pieczonka). \n\nNot one to neglect his symphonic work, Dala will be a guest conductor with the [Thunder Bay Symphony Orchestra](http://tbso.ca/) in 2016\\. He'll conduct a \"more traditional programme\", which includes the overture to Gluck's _Alceste_, Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto in A Minor (with soloist [Katherine Chi](http://www.katherinechi.com/)), and Schumann's Symphony no. 2\\. \"I was really pleased, I was actually given the chance to weigh in on the programming. [The Grieg] will be great, I mean that's such a warhorse, but the administration wanted to find a program that wasn't just all warhorses. The Schumann symphonies are really such powerful and beautiful pieces, but they are not over-programmed, I'll put it that way. They're very rarely done. I've conducted the first one, and I've worked on the fourth one. The second one was written in a really fertile time in Schumann's life. I think he was suffering from some form of depression which is what took him later on, this is still in the earlier stages. And then he wrote this piece as a sort of therapy, and it just bubbles forth; it has such incredible energy and dynamism, and one of the most stunningly beautiful slow movements of any symphony by anybody, I think.\" \n\nI couldn't help but ask Dala if there were any pieces outstanding on his to-do list. \"For highlights, I'd say _Wozzeck_ of Berg, _Pelléas_, _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ of Britten. And then things like the Bartók Concerto for Orchestra, the Verdi _Requiem_, and Beethoven's _Missa Solemnis_. I'm hoping within the next few years, certainly the last two will be realized.\" Not a bad list, I told him. \n\n[_Postcard from Morocco_](http://uoftopera.ca/?page_id=566) runs at UofT Opera March 12-15 at the MacMillan Theatre, Edward Johnson Building, 80 Queen's Park.

I don't know much bout the [masque tradition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masque), but I've learned that it was most popular in the 16th and early 17th centuries, and combined music, acting, dancing, and even architecture into a piece of theatre meant to flatter the man paying for all of it. _So You Want To Write A Masque_? was a fun look at how this art form comes together. The music was provided by soprano [Michele DeBoer](http://www.tafelmusik.org/about/choir/bios/michele-deboer), lutenist [Lucas Harris](http://www.tafelmusik.org/about/bios/lucas-harris), and violinist and \"maestro\" [Larry Beckwith](http://www.torontomasquetheatre.com/node/9), who is also the founder and Artistic Director of Toronto Masque Theatre. The acting, dancing, and architecture were covered by improv clown duo Nicholas Dénoument and Mina Kalishnikova of the [Gorgonetrevitch Corps de Ballet Nationale](http://whetstoneproductions.com/Whetstone_Productions/Bethany.html) (true names: [David-Benjamin Tomlinson](http://whetstoneproductions.com/Whetstone_Productions/David_Bio.html) and [Diana Kolpak](http://www.dianakolpak.ca/Bio.html)). \n\nAs a newcomer to Toronto Masque Theatre, I doubt that _So You Want To Write A Masque?_ is indicative of the rest of their season. I still had fun in what was a quasi-staged, quasi-improvised unfurling of a masque, complete with audience volunteers, and a makeshift set of scarves, chairs, and hand puppets. Nicholas and Mina were hilarious as the disruptive clown troupe, interrupting a pleasant night of Renaissance and Baroque music. Beckwith, DeBoer, and Harris were a fantastic trio, both musically, and in accommodating the unruly demands of the pushy clowns. The improv factor was exciting, since I realized it had been a _long_ time since I'd really seen that live; at times the delivery was corny, and the audience members seemed less than enthusiastic about their involvement in the masque. Still, I think its a good idea that I hope will start to reach younger listeners; I think a sense of humour is a perfect bridge between arguably obscure music and its potential audience. ",

        "body": "<p>\n\tAs part of the \n\t<a href=\"http://www.tso.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto Symphony Orchestra</a>'s New Creations Festival, I saw a fantastic in-concert performance of <a href=\"http://www.fabermusic.com/composers/george-benjamin\" target=\"_blank\">George Benjamin</a>'s opera <em>Written on Skin</em>. The British composer took the podium for the night, conducting a spectacular cast and the always exciting TSO through this disturbing, otherworldly score. I didn't now much about <em>Written on Skin</em>, except that it had its premiere in 2012 at Aix-en-Provence, and the next year it ran at the Royal Opera House. As I sat in Roy Thomson Hall, I was surprised at how immediately I thought, \"Oh, I <em>have</em> to see this staged.\" It's a rare thing for an in-concert opera to jump out at me with its visual potential, but something about <em>Written on Skin</em> really stuck in my head. The libretto is by British playwright <a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/author/martin-crimp/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Crimp</a>, based on the 800-year old story of the troubadour<a href=\"http://schmopera.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=3045&amp;action=edit&amp;message=10\" target=\"_blank\">Guillem de Cabestany</a> (the story also appears in Boccaccio's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decameron\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Decameron</em></a>). The Protector is a moral man who wants to immortalize his life's good deeds, and he hires The Boy, an \"illuminator of manuscripts\" to do so. The Protectors wife, Agnès, has a tryst with The Boy, and when The Protector finds out, he murders The Boy and <em>feeds his heart</em> to Agnès. He tries to kill Agnès too, but she takes her own life instead, jumping from the balcony. It's a dense story, an old story about human beings and their petty emotions, and I loved how Crimp made it unclear who the heroes and villains were. It's not often that I have a full 180-degree spin on my opinion of a protagonist, but it certainly happened with Agnès. There were moments where the characters spoke in the third person, or as a narrator of their own scene; I liked the effect, and I wondered if Crimp was trying to tell us that a tale of infidelity and jealousy is one of the cornerstones of storytelling.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.barbarahannigan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Barbara Hannigan</a> sang the role of Agnès (also in the Aix-en-Provence and London premieres), and I loved how the lines seemed blurred between what Hannigan sang and what Benjamin wrote. Agnès and Hannigan seemed entirely one person, even without a physical world created by sets and costumes. I was totally drawn in to what I thought was going to be a <em>femme fatale</em>-type of character, manipulating young men into her bed because she's bored. By the end of the opera, I realized how limiting it would be to be a <em>femme fatale</em>in 13th-century, and that Agnès was really just a trapped, under-stimulated woman, perhaps at the end of her rope when it came to bottling up her own needs and desires. I won't say there wasn't something dangerous about Agnès, and Hannigan found all the right moments to remind us that her character wasn't angelic. Vocally, Hannigan was in top form, using an enormous colour palette of sounds. She had some extraordinarily grand moments of singing, but I think some of my favourite moments came in Agnès weaknesses. There's an <em>incredible</em> scene where The Protector reads aloud a letter from The Boy about his sexual encounter with Agnès; Agnès can't read, and the desperation in her voice, the fear of being beholden to someone she distrusts for important information, that was moving for me.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n<a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428720451645/Christopher_PurvesCliveBarda-683x1024.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lyoGAr0j1LZ8CIhNb3Vkvxo2ORK0v5UnrJeQE6IoqpQbGntK4s22Ec7Hy6gV2rojUN47mEqxXsygnrWbx4J6F-OHjgQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lyoGAr0j1LZ8CIhNb3Vkvxo2ORK0v5UnrJeQE6IoqpQbGntK4s22Ec7Hy6gV2rojUN47mEqxXsygnrWbx4J6F-OHjgQ=s1200\"></a>\n<figcaption>Baritone Christopher Purves. Photo: Clive Barda</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\tThe Protector was sung by baritone <a href=\"http://christopherpurves.com/press/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Purves</a>, who joined Hannigan in the Aix and London casts. He was spectacular as a singer and actor; his voice had a warm, almost friendly baritone sound, which is what kept me on his side for a while. When he showed his colours as a vindictive, morally superior husband who sees his wife as \"property,\" it was akin to finding out a dark secret about someone you've known for a while.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs The Boy, countertenor \n\t<a href=\"http://www.bernhard-landauer.at/\" target=\"_blank\">Bernhard Landauer</a> was beautifully passive. The Boy was easily manipulated into bed by Agnès (perhaps there was willingness there, too); when he writes about their affair for The Protector to read, it felt like one of those good deeds done by naïve people who don't know that they're in over their heads. I loved that Benjamin wrote the character of The Boy as a countertenor; the youth and frailty are exaggerated, and the possibility of real, reciprocal sexual energy between he and Agnès are minimized.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n<a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428720509033/SzaboBoHuang_Fotor-681x1024.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9ugsfo9ss7Y5pOYZWvThWv1ei76j0DYPA4svu_TTQhSoQcp3esbSjYhk5_7P5xEMw0d8qdj-zyRWRQxIuxSgRQAGCEIK8Q\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9ugsfo9ss7Y5pOYZWvThWv1ei76j0DYPA4svu_TTQhSoQcp3esbSjYhk5_7P5xEMw0d8qdj-zyRWRQxIuxSgRQAGCEIK8Q=s1200\"></a>\n<figcaption>Mezzo-soprano Krisztina Szabó.

As the Angels who advise The Protector, they had some of the coolest text setting I've heard in a while; Benjamin evokes a feeling of voices in one's head with short, jabbing words. Isaiah had some gorgeous lines to sing and his voice filled Roy Thomson Hall with a clear ring. At one point The Protector questions The Boy about him having slept with Agnès; The Boy lies for Agnès, saying he slept with her sister, Marie. Krisztina's scene as Marie is a very cool moment of an imagined encounter; Benjamin writes the lines of The Boy and Marie almost on top of each other, Marie \"finishing\" The Boy's made-up details of their tryst. I love Krisztina Szabó.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe TSO, of course, sounded fantastic playing Benjamin's score, under his baton. There were odd instruments (did I see a glass armonica?), and grossly loud moments, and the whole thing felt like a film score and then some. I'm officially eager to see \n\t<em>Written on Skin</em> in a staged production, and from the comments I overheard in the Roy Thomson Hall lobby as I was leaving, I'm not the only one\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\tYesterday I went to Trinity-St. Paul's Centre to hear <a href=\"http://capellaintima.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Capella Intima</a> team up with the <a href=\"http://www.galleryplayers.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Gallery Players of Niagara</a> for a night of Baroque tunes, including an in-concert performance of Purcell's <em>Dido and Aeneas</em>. I admit to feeling like an outsider in Toronto's Early Music scene, and besides an <a href=\"http://schmopera.com/bud-roach-on-capella-intima/\" target=\"_blank\">articulate and enthusiastic interview</a> given by Capella Intima founder Bud Roach, I had few expectations for the evening. Roach prefaced the concert by telling us that Italian Baroque was the usual repertoire for Capella Intima, and that a night of English music was a departure from the norm. I think it should become the norm, since the collaboration between the Gallery Players and Capella Intima was one of the more satisfying musical experiences I've had in a while.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first half was made up of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerts_of_Antient_Music\" target=\"_blank\">\"Antient Music\"</a>, a term that was new for me; glees, catches, and rounds come from the 17th-century tradition of singing clubs (which strike me as the original Glee Club). Here, Capella Intima showed off some incredible solo and ensemble singing, supported by the exciting chamber ensemble of the <a href=\"http://www.galleryplayers.ca/about_performers_0607.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Gallery Players of Niagara</a> (<a href=\"http://windermere.braveform.com/docs/rona.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rona Goldensher</a> and <a href=\"http://legacy.wlu.ca/page.php?grp_id=160&amp;p=19368\" target=\"_blank\">Julie Baumgartel</a>, violins, <a href=\"http://www.innerchamber.ca/#!brandon-chui/cc0e\" target=\"_blank\">Brandon Chui</a>, viola, <a href=\"http://vancouveracademyofmusic.com/vam-alumni/gay/\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Gay</a>, cello, <a href=\"http://www.borysmedicky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Borys Medicky</a>, harpsichord). Bud Roach was the first to sing in his bright and agile tenor voice, starting with Purcell's \"Strike the Viol\". I loved how he sounded, full of energy and intent, with a heady sound that filled Trinity-St. Paul's. The singers of Capella Intima carried the first half with amazingly tight ensemble moments and lots of subtle musical gestures that sounded as one. Together with the Gallery Players, the performers always managed to find the big picture, the reason behind all the details in the score. The best part of the evening was the fact that everyone onstage looked to be having fun. There was a serious chamber music vibe, with lots of eye contact and passing off of phrases. It struck me that these are still rare things onstage, and I think it speaks volumes about the skill among these two groups.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428721025442/EmilyHeadshot-768x1024.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bzGEqr9k9oe_9n3bysf_ivsiodbghDG5AvcfQd2Bl3T_0hPz8LoBnKEV__1tZK0z2QRhqG0LqrjkJaonphk6fWjQyQo\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bzGEqr9k9oe_9n3bysf_ivsiodbghDG5AvcfQd2Bl3T_0hPz8LoBnKEV__1tZK0z2QRhqG0LqrjkJaonphk6fWjQyQo=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Soprano Emily Klassen</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tChoosing English repertoire allowed the audience to hear Capella Intima's great connection to the text; they took all possible chances for word-painting, dramatic impulse, and comedy. I'm sure it's there too in their Italian rep, but it was so clear in English. I kept marvelling at how much great music exists that we rarely get to hear, like Purcell's duet for tenor and baritone, \"Sound the Trumpet\", which was impressively sung by Bud Roach and baritone David Roth. The trios sung by Shiela Dietrich, <a href=\"http://emilyklassen.com/bio.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://emilyklassen.com/bio.html\">Emily Klassen</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.naxos.com/person/Jennifer_Ens_Modolo/11806.htm\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.naxos.com/person/Jennifer_Ens_Modolo/11806.htm\">Jennifer Ens Modolo</a>, like the stunning \"On a Musician's Tomb\" by W. Harington, were like precursors to Mozart's <em>drei Damen</em>. On the more ridiculous side, there was Benjamin Cooke's \"The Longitude\", in which the phrases \"be pissed on\" and \"be shit on\" were repeated ad nauseam, like insane babbling or jazz scatting (sorry) gone wild. All that Baroque music wasn't so precious after all, it seems.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428721094574/David-headshot.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O_lR2FeLdqnRyHyrFMS5JJOcP7Tmw5E0co8QS175ExtFTaDk4D-7Rkq6IrzT-68UF326GVV0F8ldAOLXBczqCcapny_6\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O_lR2FeLdqnRyHyrFMS5JJOcP7Tmw5E0co8QS175ExtFTaDk4D-7Rkq6IrzT-68UF326GVV0F8ldAOLXBczqCcapny_6=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tThe second half was a beautiful reading of <em>Dido and Aeneas</em>. Jennifer Ens Modolo was subtle and easy in the title role, never superimposing sadness onto Purcell's already melancholy score; she let the music do the work, and the result was really quite touching. David Roth was strong as Aeneas, and Sheila Dietrich and Emily Klassen were gorgeous both as Dido's maids, and as the Witches. Bud Roach sang the roles of the Sorcerer and the Sailor; I've never seen anyone have so much fun with a role as with Roach's Sorcerer. He let the comedy of <em>Dido </em> exist, and risked a less beautiful sound for the sake of an otherworldly character. This is the kind of thing I mean when I say that Capella Intima saw the big picture, the gesture in all the details.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428721123802/SheilaDietrich.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BisEpuu6Xy3xL859WB67S7-7RAVU7ouVxnhaePUtvuehPqXKaVaIZ6lfkeDHxc3VnXDn-5aXl3_9uaiJ35gUsvAB1XFtog\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BisEpuu6Xy3xL859WB67S7-7RAVU7ouVxnhaePUtvuehPqXKaVaIZ6lfkeDHxc3VnXDn-5aXl3_9uaiJ35gUsvAB1XFtog=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Soprano Sheila Dietrich</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tIt was a real musical treat to hear Capella Intima and the Gallery Players share a stage. There's something about the Early Music sound that is refreshing, like an Italian soda or orange sorbet. These artists are delivering the real deal, with no need for Baroque-era homework in order to enjoy what they're doing. Be sure to check <a href=\"http://capellaintima.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"http://capellaintima.com/\">Capella Intima</a>'s website in order to catch their upcoming performances; I think they're a strong part of the Early Music whole in Toronto, and more people should head out to hear them. Bravi, everyone.<br>\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\tFor a while, I've been itching for a change: I wanted to see more non-musical theatre. Maybe it's because opera lets me hear fantastic singers regularly, but there's rarely a person onstage who started their training in drama, rather than music. I was really thrilled to be able to catch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephenssimon\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Stephens</a>' play <a href=\"https://www.canadianstage.com/Online/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Harper Regan</em> at Canadian Stage</a>, which premiered in 2008 at the Royal National Theatre. I figured it would quell my straight theatre bug, and I was clearly curious to see <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662504/\" target=\"_blank\">Molly Parker</a> (<em>House of Cards</em>, <em>Deadwood</em>) in the title role. <em>Harper Regan</em> is inspired by the Greek plays surrounding the <a href=\"http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/houseofatreus/a/houseofatreus.htm\" target=\"_blank\">House of Atreus</a>, and the stories of a cursed family. \"The lesson the Greeks passed down to us is that consciousness – recognizing and articulating the seed of a problem – can provoke change,\" writes director <a href=\"https://www.canadianstage.com/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=7C4503FD-70D1-460E-A2F6-006F96045BD8\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Jocelyn</a>in his notes. Harper Regan learns that her father is dying, and after getting denied time off from work to visit him, she decides to secretly leave anyway. She arrives at the hospital too late to see her dad, and spends the leftover time on her illicit trip doing what she can't in front of her family. Jocelyn, who is also the Canadian Stage's Artistic &amp; General Director, says, \"Harper adorns a new identity, a leather jacket she steals from a bar, and throws herself into a series of unforeseen encounters which, accumulatively, will enable her to recognise and articulate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is something powerfully satisfying about the way Stephens writes. His characters have conversations so densely packed with meaning that they really stay with you. The dialogue always cuts to the point of the scene quickly, but never seems to lack an organic progression between the characters. They spoke with almost imperceptible oddities, like complimenting one's skin or shoulders; the British-isms (bollocks, etc.) even sounded as though they were the mannerisms of the people in Harper's world.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428721368975/16104925294_e2c0b963e6_k.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H2dEquVS-Vwnat6bfe9WpWAeCDL41UIKTpo4nPcswXq8_Ta1b93uVfVdDM102qB-y6wxfIT-2DLnBQVhlEGsbl54G4yLvQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H2dEquVS-Vwnat6bfe9WpWAeCDL41UIKTpo4nPcswXq8_Ta1b93uVfVdDM102qB-y6wxfIT-2DLnBQVhlEGsbl54G4yLvQ=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Vivien Endicott-Douglas and Molly Parker. Photo: David Hou</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tIn the title role, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/themollyparker\" target=\"_blank\">Molly Parker</a> was extraordinary. Her Harper had all the sides of a real human being, beginning with meek and agreeable in front of her boss (Parker's frailty was so realistic that I was momentarily worried), to placating and subordinate at home with her family, and finally as a deeply curious, unashamed woman fighting responsibilities and circumstances. For me, Harper was one of those characters that I really grew to understand over two hours. I loved that Stephens wrote a character with \"faces\", open for interpretation over which one is the real deal.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI was excited to see Parker, of course, but the entire cast gave fantastic performances.<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1659389/\" target=\"_blank\">Vivien Endicott-Douglas</a> played Sarah Regan, Harper's daughter, a sullen, frustratingly smart teenaged girl. She was a beautiful mix of a teenager's poor foresight, and a young adult who is sick of having her thoughts ignored. Vivien was also cast as Justine Ross, a nurse at the hospital where Harper's father died. I loved the choice of casting these roles together; in both characters, Vivien was a confusing, somehow wise, daughter-like figure, one around which Harper doesn't really know how to act.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428721391965/16726170592_06e80f8143_k.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cUz7KDuWUs1CecYxcpdT4dc44R8potKX30shjtZus6Ej2aYYBxSRqsv3p43Mp6Yv6PxgyrNyCvQsQLJhuGm_Oefje3bd\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cUz7KDuWUs1CecYxcpdT4dc44R8potKX30shjtZus6Ej2aYYBxSRqsv3p43Mp6Yv6PxgyrNyCvQsQLJhuGm_Oefje3bd=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Izaak Smith and Molly Parker. Photo: David Hou</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0687843/\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Poch-Goldin</a> played both Seth Regan, Harper's husband, and James Fortune, a married man with whom Harper has an Internet hookup. As Seth, Poch-Goldin establishes a cool, tongue-bitten marriage, in which he plays the role of the apologetic. I loved how Harper's fling, James, appeared to be a more confident version of Seth; by the end of <em>Harper Regan</em>, we can see that Seth was really just a more troubled version of James. Poch-Goldin had a beautiful monologue in the final scene, which reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/savage-love/Lets-Say-Im-A-Pedophile-83404047.html\" target=\"_blank\">this piece heartbreaking piece by advice columnist Dan Savage</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs both Harper's boss, Mr. Barnes, and her mother's new husband, Duncan, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512620/\" target=\"_blank\">Hardee T. Lineham</a> left a huge impression on me, beginning with his great, ornery rant about how \"there's always the Internet!\"<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0341289/\" target=\"_blank\"> Lynne Griffin</a> was a refreshing dose of reality and frankness as Harper's mother, Alison. Hers was an incredibly real scene, in which a daughter is exasperated with her mother, and the mother is done caring; it's beautifully written, and Lynne is really stunning. I absolutely adored <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3575328/\" target=\"_blank\">Izaak Smith</a> as Tobias and Mahesh, both teenaged characters who have charmingly awkward encounters with the cougar-like Harper. Honestly, the scenes between Tobias and Harper were moments of genius; Stephens managed to write down that unsure and unpredictable way that teenagers act, when they're talking to adults who aren't their parents or their teacher. Cringe-worthy and endearing at the same time. <a href=\"http://companytheatre.ca/ensemble/philip-riccio/\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Riccio</a> packed a huge punch in his short scene as Mickey, the morning drunk who does drugs in a bar. He had that charisma that seems to outweigh all his bad habits, and so I understood when Harper started to get tempted. Riccio had some of those moments of dense dialogue, and his character was one that stuck with me.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428721492828/16519963387_803f016cc3_k.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f2ruwAO_q6v3QDlrLyozu9kmfBhefA7va9yuz-EO_UcB_QbUFCqfvDYKjGFCxq58c1vBhnKhkmkpREmG4woLcOASOhmr\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f2ruwAO_q6v3QDlrLyozu9kmfBhefA7va9yuz-EO_UcB_QbUFCqfvDYKjGFCxq58c1vBhnKhkmkpREmG4woLcOASOhmr=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Molly Parker and Philip Riccio.

The minimal design by <a href=\"http://www.abouttheartists.com/artists/287497-debra-hanson\" target=\"_blank\">Debra Hanson</a> was suggestive and versatile, and allowed us to focus entirely on the characters and what they were saying. The cast were seated upstage and dimly lit, almost entirely throughout, reminding the audience that they, like Harper, couldn't ignore the people in her life. Sound Designer<a href=\"http://ttdb.ca/people/thomas-ryder-payne/\" target=\"_blank\"> Thomas Ryder Payne</a>'s scene transitions were overwhelming, and often startlingly loud; I loved, though, how they went from being oppressive to feeling like white noise, like a much-needed scream after a tensely quiet moment. Two powerful and opposing tableaus closed each of the acts, the first was Harper smoking in a leather jacket, and the last was the Regan family at the breakfast table. It gave a film-like quality to the closing of the piece.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Harper Regan</em> was a totally successful experiment in the hunt for non-musical theatre fixes. The cast is stunning, and the production serves the story beautifully, so do try to see it this month. It plays until March 22nd at the Bluma Appel Theatre, 27 Front St. E. <a href=\"https://www.canadianstage.com/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=harper#tickets\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for details and to purchase tickets</a>.\n</p>",

Maybe it’s because opera lets me hear fantastic singers regularly, but there’s rarely a person onstage who started their training in drama, rather than music. I was really thrilled to be able to catch Simon Stephens‘ play Harper Regan at Canadian Stage, which premiered in 2008 at the Royal National Theatre. I figured it would quell my straight theatre bug, and I was clearly curious to see Molly Parker (House of Cards, Deadwood) in the title role. Harper Regan is inspired by the Greek plays surrounding the House of Atreus, and the stories of a cursed family"

        "body": "<h2>1. Where did your passion for Early Music come from?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI had a real epiphany when I participated in the <a href=\"http://www.tafelmusik.org/education/artist-training/tafelmusik-baroque-summer-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Tafelmusik Baroque Summer Institute</a>. My musical training in school was on the oboe, and I worked with orchestras, both Canadian and American, for a number of years before I started singing. So back in 2006, when I was just starting out as a tenor, the world of Carissimi and Monteverdi was all very new. My voice seemed to be suited to composers like Bach and Handel, but the earlier my exploration went, the more fascinated I was by the turn of the 17th century, and how the groundwork was laid for what we now think of as the principals of Western music. That basic idea of conveying text in an emotional, meaningful way for an audience is something I find incredibly appealing – and challenging! And the performance tradition of this \"New Music\", as Caccini labelled it, was self-accompanied, which has been the most satisfying part of my Early Music inquiry. Singing to my own accompaniment on the Baroque guitar is the furthest musical point from playing a Mahler symphony or Strauss tone poem in an orchestra. But it's endlessly interesting to me now, because of this whole new world of the beginnings of tonality. It's as though my formal education as an oboist excluded some of the most exciting parts of our Western musical heritage – almost like an English major whose reading list starts a full century after Shakespeare!\n</p>\n<h2>2. How have singing and guitar become balanced parts of your work as a musician?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI don't think of myself as a \"real\" guitarist (and most guitarists would agree!). I'm a singer specializing in the performance traditions of the early Baroque, and that means learning an instrument well enough to provide my own accompaniment. Of course it's possible to sing in a stylistically compelling way without strumming or plucking at the same time, as almost all singers do, but I've found that the best way to figure out how to make this music as freely expressive as the composers clearly intended is to work it all out as a solo performance. And now that I've done this for a little while, with a couple of recordings and many solo concerts under my belt, I have a much clearer sense of how to approach any repertoire, whether it be sacred music, opera, solo, or ensemble. As far as my work as a musician, I can certainly attest to the fact that seventeenth-century <a href=\"http://www.maestros-of-the-guitar.com/alfabeto.html\" target=\"_blank\">alfabeto</a> arias are NOT paying the bills! However, my efforts have been noticed internationally, and the feedback has been universally encouraging, so I will continue down this path, and see where it takes me.\n</p>\n<h2>3. You mention that audiences can get \"context\" from performances of 17th century music that \"has only come to light in recent years\" with a revival of Early Music interest. Can you elaborate?</h2>\n<p>\n\tThis quote from the <a href=\"http://capellaintima.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Capella Intima website</a> actually refers to the use of readings in some of our concerts. Probably the best example of this would be a programme of music by Benedictine nuns from Milan (\"Celestial Sirens\") that we have revived several times. The work of composers like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiara_Margarita_Cozzolani\" target=\"_blank\">Maria Cozzolani</a> has only re-emerged in the last decade or so, thanks mainly to the efforts of one particular scholar. Cozzolani composed with a very unique voice. She was published, and her music was widely known. Today most concertgoers do not even recognize her name, let alone understand how remarkable her accomplishments were. Incorporating readings from the period can really help to convey to an audience the cultural, and specifically musical, climate at the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 17th century was a period of great change in musical styles, but we hear so little of it in concert that it can be difficult to really get a sense of how it all fits together. Composers like Vivaldi did not just appear out of nowhere. He inherited much of his harmonic and rhythmic language from the composers of generations before. What Capella Intima attempts to do is fill in some of these gaps, outside of what is thought of as the \"standard\" repertoire.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428722379012/CapellaIntimaHeader.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XbEwfVrrse9ZlMVZNNeLkxpH3CMhKGtZ69Po9Z8KAmTae7SN0VU2hxuBogssYGoEZTUoPC34AWyxMz_urRLBB1HRmsB8CQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XbEwfVrrse9ZlMVZNNeLkxpH3CMhKGtZ69Po9Z8KAmTae7SN0VU2hxuBogssYGoEZTUoPC34AWyxMz_urRLBB1HRmsB8CQ=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<h2>4. How do you go about choosing a programme for Capella Intima?</h2>\n<p>\n\tCapella Intima programmes always start with a trip to the library. Often those visits spark an interest in a specific direction that requires some online hunting, which seems to become easier every month, since people are sharing scores, and libraries are digitizing their collections. One of my favourite places to visit (both online and in person!) is the <a href=\"http://www.museomusicabologna.it/biblioteca.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Biblioteca della musica</a> in Bologna. If you show up at this library prepared, knowing what it is you need, and take no breaks at all, it is possible to leave at the end of the day having taken about 2,000 photographs of scores! And the people there are so kind and helpful. In virtually every book I've seen that deals with the music of the Italian Baroque, the authors thank the staff of this library for their generosity, and it makes me smile when I think of these librarians, and this very special place.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom that point, I just look over the part-books (most works were never published in full score, so you can only see the soprano part in one book, the continuo line in another, and so on) and see what jumps off of the page. Sometimes it's a melodic motif that I think is interesting, or a text that grabs my attention. And then…lots of time at the computer, creating a clean edition. Then I usually have a few visits with my friend Gabriele Erasmi, who does all of the Italian and Latin translations. He, too, has been extremely generous, and his guidance continues to be an invaluable part of Capella Intima's development. A core principal of the ensemble is to present the unfamiliar. It's a completely different concert experience for an audience to hear a piece of music for the first time, and this sort of presentation really interests me. It does make our concerts a tougher sell than programmes of Bach or Handel, but the reward for doing all of the organization and administration for Capella Intima is the ability to choose the repertoire I really want to do. Putting together unique programmes with great people is a very musically satisfying experience!\n</p>\n<h2>5. What do you look forward to about your upcoming <em>Dido and Aeneas</em>? You mention this concert is a \"departure\"; how so?</h2>\n<p>\n\tWell it is most definitely new ground for us. For a start, this is the very first time that Capella Intima has presented a concert in English! And secondly, it will be our first programme where most of the audience is familiar with the main work. When it comes to <em>Dido and Aeneas</em>, this is hardly a Toronto premiere! And yet, this has been a very happy challenge to put together. The first time that we know <em>Dido</em> was done in concert was not, as you might think, in these current days of no time and little money. It was actually performed in concert in 1787, and this is the sort of performance that we are trying to recreate. At the same time as popular concerts featuring <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerts_of_Antient_Music\" target=\"_blank\">\"Antient Music\"</a> were being presented, the taverns were full of music provided by Singing Clubs. Catches, rounds, and glees were all the rage, so our first half consists of some of Purcell's more popular airs, interspersed with interesting bits from the period of this first, concert performance of <em>Dido and Aeneas</em>. Most of these short pieces are on a \"musical\" theme – and most of them unknown – with one notable exception that includes a lot of foul language. So everyone should come out on Friday, even if it's just for the swearing!\n</p>",

        "body": "<h2>1. Why is the Institute for Women Conductors an important program in today's classical music scene?</h2>\n<p>\n\tDespite the greater participation of women in advanced conducting programs, many talented women \"stall out\" before reaching the top tier of the conducting profession. This new program aspires to help participants to bridge the gap between early career success and being engaged to conduct at the world's top performing arts institutions; in doing so, the program is expected to stimulate a national conversation about women conductors and the barriers they continue to face in professional advancement.<a href=\"http://dallasopera.org/learn/womens-conducting-institute/\" target=\"_blank\"> The Institute for Women Conductors at The Dallas Opera</a> will also work to connect interested parties (e.g. artist managers, symphony CEOs and opera company general directors) with carefully selected, top-tier young women conductors, focus more media attention on the issue and last, but certainly not least, elevate the profile of talented women conductors in the minds of key decision makers—those who will select tomorrow's music directors and guest conductors.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428722580079/Paiement2_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3fxWHjXack33A_CH1X3WmfLMn9x6AuWc6_RPQC2SuL5YuBm00z4BQuJrw8aLOPU7Nto2CGIlzswir2mCDyYWr5xVEl6p\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3fxWHjXack33A_CH1X3WmfLMn9x6AuWc6_RPQC2SuL5YuBm00z4BQuJrw8aLOPU7Nto2CGIlzswir2mCDyYWr5xVEl6p=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Nicole Paiement leading a rehearsal in the Winspear Opera House, Dallas. Photo: Karen Almond</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>2. What level of conducting experience is suitable for the program?</h2>\n<p>\n\tThrough its application and screening process, TDO is recruiting participants aged 40 and younger who have already distinguished themselves in some aspect of classical music or opera. Successful applicants may already have achieved some initial success as a regularly performing conductor, but we also encourage distinctively talented instrumentalists, opera coaches and pianists, concertmasters, music staff, composers, and even well-established singers to apply. In general, we would expect the applicant to have at least some limited track record in conducting, but there are many cases over the last 200 years where sheer musical talent trumped limited past experience as a conductor; you need only look at Gustav Mahler's early career as an example to observe the speed at which a conductor can develop if the right opportunities are given to a uniquely gifted individual. Consequently, we encourage candidates reflecting a wide range of musical backgrounds to apply.\n</p>\n<h2>3. What kind of professional advice do young conductors need at the beginning of their careers, and how does the Institute for Women Conductors fit in?</h2>\n<p>\n\tIn our view, young women conductors need a blend of musical training and experience in performance, as well as coaching and guidance in important aspects of career management – especially in a field still so dominated by men. For the former area, Institute participants will have the chance to work directly with the superb <a href=\"http://dallasopera.org/about/staff/orchestra/\" target=\"_blank\">Dallas Opera Orchestra</a>, and participate in master classes with our Music Director [Emmanuel Villaume] and Principal Guest Conductor [Nicole Paiement], as well as hearing perspectives on how to partner most effectively with a concertmaster – an important contributor to success for any conductor. In the area of career management, we will also include other elements in the curriculum, including: finding the right artist manager; personal branding and image management; conducting successful media interviews (rehearsed through role plays); guest lecturers providing various perspectives on succeeding in a male-dominated field, and more technical areas such as selecting repertoire for career impact, the role of contemporary opera, and accepting and declining specific engagements. For many of these areas, there are no \"right\" answers or approaches; rather, we aspire to sensitize the program participants to the underlying issues and suggest a range of responses from which they can select the approach that works best for them.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428722660755/KAP_7316A_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iDk27_zl8nyZicfHCiTBBWRvZXuk6V-09qdkqLjLX-KaeHJQOTzTsPtqo_G6ypoRpkpxmjL8PmscGNoi8IAvBRNXMyHk\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iDk27_zl8nyZicfHCiTBBWRvZXuk6V-09qdkqLjLX-KaeHJQOTzTsPtqo_G6ypoRpkpxmjL8PmscGNoi8IAvBRNXMyHk=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Music Director Emmanuel Villaume.

More and more women are pursuing conducting as a career; how do you think this will change the classical music industry, or its reception?</h2>\n<p>\n\tConducting, like any other profession, can be thought of as a \"pipeline\", where new entrants gradually increase their skills and build their reputations, develop their careers, and then eventually retire. As noted before, many more women are pursuing conducting training, and, with the right opportunities and encouragement, will enter the field and eventually distinguish themselves as top-tier international conductors. In general, many other fields, such as law, business, government, academics – even airline pilots – have benefitted greatly over previous decades from being able to draw on the \"missing 50%\" of their respective talent pools, as women have entered the field; this situation is the same for conducting, and certainly orchestras have benefitted artistically from hiring more women players in their ranks over the last several decades. In addition, women conductors will influence the classical music field in two further ways. First, by adding so much talent to the underlying talent pool, they will naturally increase the range of the artistic approaches taken to both new and established works, which is always beneficial for any art form. Second, having a better balance between men and women conductors on the podium allows the performers to better \"mirror\" their audiences, making classical music with orchestra a more representative and inclusive experience. This inclusiveness will help performing arts organizations sell tickets, raise money, and better serve the community in which they reside.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tApplications for the <a href=\"http://dallasopera.org/learn/womens-conducting-institute/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Women Conductors</a> are due April 15, 2015.

It was one of the coolest things I've seen in a long time, made better by the few expectations I had beforehand. The Pulitzer Prize winning composer (_the little matchgirl passion_) asks, \"what if a piece were so quiet, and intimate, and so personal to the performers, that you needed to be right next to them or you would hear almost nothing?\" _The Whisper Opera_ is aptly named; it's certainly a piece that achieves Lang's aim to write \"pieces that try to highlight things that can only happen live.\" \n\nLang also wrote the libretto, starting by typing in short Internet searches like \"when I am alone I always\", and collecting the different ways people have finished the sentence. _The Whisper Opera_ is divided into four parts; the text in each part was delivered in whispered answers to four unfinished searches. \n\n1. \"when I am alone I always\" (\"…think,\" \"…think of you,\" \"…cry\")\n2. \"they said I was crazy but I\" (\"…did it anyway,\" \"…knew it,\")\n3. \"when I think of you I think of\" (\"…us together,\" \"…love,\" \"…your sexy body\")\n4. \"it's not my fault that I am so\" (\"…sexy,\" \"…busy\")\n\nI thought David Lang's piece itself was fascinating, and it was entirely integrated with the direction and design by [Jim Findlay](http://jimfindlaynyc.com/). The \"stage\" was raised to about chin-level when seated, and the audience was placed in small aisles that extended towards the centre of the space (we were informed that the seating arrangement would be unusual, and they weren't lying). The [International Contemporary Ensemble](http://iceorg.org/) ([Claire Chase](http://www.clairechase.net/), flutes, [Joshua Rubin](http://iceorg.org/about/staffbios/rubin), clarinets, [Kivie Cahn-Lipman](http://cellokivie.weebly.com/), cello, and [Ross Karre](http://rosskarre.com/), percussion) inhabited different corners of the space throughout the piece, playing Lang's eerie and beautiful score. They whispered along with soprano[ Tony Arnold](http://www.screecher.com/), who was the central voice throughout. Their instruments were part of the design, which was beautifully raw. Bare lightbulbs hung alongside bass drums, and even the creaky set added to the earthy, inclusive feeling to the piece. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428723134683/David-Lang-Photo-Credit-Peter-Serling-682x1024.jpg)\n<figcaption>Composer David Lang. Photo: Peter Serling</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe performers were all mesmerizing, and the score was full of new sounds. David Lang makes his listeners lean in close with his sonic palate, and he throws in curious sounds, like fingertips on a xylophone, to keep the attention fixed on the players. The text setting was entirely whispered, which demanded a lot from Tony Arnold; she had by far the most text, and she delivered it with incredible precision and meaning, even without her voice. \n\n_The Whisper Opera_ happens all around you, making your ears more sensitive; I realized that each section of audience seating would show a completely different experience of the piece, and I was unusually curious to see another performance from a new vantage point. I just thought the whole things was so _neat_, and one of those rare performances that have you completely rapt. I love the piece, and [Jim Findlay](http://jimfindlaynyc.com/)'s production visualized Lang's concept perfectly. \n\nI'd tell you all to run and see the final performance of _The Whisper Opera_, but it's indeed sold out. At least this great show isn't going unnoticed.",

        "body": "Wednesday night, I went to see _Don Giovanni_ at [Toronto City Opera](http://www.torontocityopera.com/#!mission-and-vision/c1bu9); I don't know much about the company, and I was most surprised to learn that they're in their 48th season. _Forty eighth!_ TCO's mission is to \"grow the art of opera. It will facilitate this by training young and/or inexperienced singers through an intense regimen of coaching in musicianship, stagecraft and performance.\" I'm a big fan of companies who create performance opportunities for young singers. There was a wide range of skill and experience among the cast, and for the most part the singers were still in the process of negotiating their technique and putting it into practice onstage. Because of Toronto City Opera's mission, and how much I support it, I'll refrain from writing a review in the same vein as I would for a professional company. \n\nThis _Don Giovanni_ used full traditional sets and costumes in this production by TCO Artistic Director [Beatrice Carpino](http://www.torontocityopera.com/#!director/cb5f); the score was led by Music Director [Adolfo de Santis](http://www.torontocityopera.com/#!music-director/cd0b) and pianist[Ivan Jovanovic](http://www.torontocityopera.com/#!our-pianist/cfra). I think that what TCO does is great for artists who crave experience, and that their goal could be even better accomplished by letting the performances be much more about a process than a product. TCO is the perfect organization to offer semi-staged or in-concert productions of opera standards, leaving lots of time to work slowly on the score and text. The end result could be a workshop-like performance, free from sets and costumes, to show audiences how opera is created from the ground up. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428723444526/Screen-Shot-2015-02-26-at-9.43.38-AM.png)\n<figcaption>Jackie McIntyre (Anna) and Nseke Brunot Theophile (Ottavio). Photo: TCO</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThere's absolutely no issue with inexperienced artists performing a piece like _Don Giovanni_, and the benefit of a project like that is that the artists to learn about the stuff of opera. Tackling style, ease with the language, and the technical hurdles of the music are the real educational gems; fully staged productions are fairly common in Toronto, and I think the real audience pull for a company like TCO is the chance to get an inside look at the learning process. I'm curious about how much interaction Toronto City Opera has with the faculty and students at University of Toronto or the Glenn Gould School over the years; performance opportunities for university-level singers can be slim, and this is a great place to get singing operatic standards. It occurred to me that it could be a chance for young pianists and conductors, too; so much of their learning comes from doing, and so on-the-job experience would be invaluable. Ivan Jovanovic deserves many kudos for playing Mozart's tricky score, and there were opportunities for him to learn as well. I'm not sure if TCO recruits young pianists and conductors for their productions, but it would be fantastic chance for talented music staff like Ivan to delve deeply (with guidance) into the art of playing Mozart _recit_, and deciphering orchestral reductions. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428723593168/Screen-Shot-2015-02-26-at-9.29.50-AM.png)\n<figcaption>Bradley Hoover (Giovanni) and Samantha Weaver (Elvira). Photo: TCO</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe TCO's impressive 48 seasons show that there are artists who want to get onstage, and that there's a creative team _and_ an audience to support them. I think more faith can be put in showing off the work singers must put into learning a foreign language, mastering technically difficult elements of their roles, and parsing the drama of their scenes. This kind of work is of most value to young artists, and translates across the stylistic board; I think the process is more interesting to the public than we may think, and with TCO, it could be worth a try. \n\nToronto City Opera has one more performance of [_Don Giovanni_](http://www.torontocityopera.com/#!cast-list-by-performance/cyd4) this Saturday at 7:30pm, 777 Bloor St W. They're also putting up Verdi's [_Un ballo in maschera_](http://www.torontocityopera.com/#!cast-list-by-performance/c34s), February 27th at 7:30pm, and a 2pm on March 1st.

        "body": "<p>\n\tIt's old news by now, but the <a href=\"http://www.metopera-digital.org/metmobile/2015-16_season_subscriptions#pg1\" target=\"_blank\">Metropolitan Opera has announced its season line-up for 2015/2016</a>. I waited a bit before writing about the season, because I couldn't seem to shake distinct feelings of exasperation. I figured that someone with more journalistic experience than myself would soon weigh in, shedding some light on what I thought were glaringly obvious problems with the Met's 15/16 season.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, there's nothing in English; yes, the productions of <em>The Barber of Seville</em> and <em>Die Fledermaus</em> are going to be sung in English, but those translations are usually lame and it's not really <em>opera in English</em>. Even if we put the language issue aside, it's a pretty conservative season. There are 24 shows in the Met's 2015/16 season, including 6 new productions, and <em>Lulu</em> (1935) is the most contemporary piece on the line-up.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEven if I were to make a case for bringing back so many standards from the repertoire (<em>Tosca</em>,<em>Turandot</em>, <em>Don Pasquale</em>), the revolving door of casting negates the whole point of these pieces. Call me naïve, but when four sopranos and three tenors juggle the roles of Tosca and Cavaradossi in a single production, you're not going to see real drama entwined with music. Same thing with the three Turandots and two Calafs. The odds of ending up with a phoned-in production are astronomical.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, amongst all the usual operatic suspects, there are things to get excited about. <a href=\"http://citizen.co.za/afp_feed_article/met-opera-aims-for-broader-audience-with-season-of-classics/\" target=\"_blank\">Shaun Tandon at <em>The Citizen</em></a> calls looks at it differently, calling it a \"season of classics\" aimed at recruiting broader audiences. I mean, there's Sondra's <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2014/04/18/sondra_radvanovsky_tackles_operas_triple_crown.html\" target=\"_blank\">Three Queens Trilogy;</a> we get to see<em>Lulu</em> and <em>Elektra</em> in one season; Dolora Zajick's Azucena is not to be missed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's not like there's nothing for me to look forward to at the Met next year, but frankly, I'm not the audience they need to convince.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat confuses me the most about the 2015/16 season is how much it resembles the last ones. The Met saw a hellish summer of 2014, with bitter union negotiations with the orchestra and chorus members, and <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-met-opera-credit-rating-downgraded-despite-labor-deal-2014-12\" target=\"_blank\">their credit rating was downgraded</a> a few months later. The public learned more about the Met's reliance on donors, and we all found out the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/06/new-york-met-opera-house-edge-precipice\" target=\"_blank\">price of those poppies</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to mention that definition of insanity, where it's when you keep doing the same thing while expecting different results. I want to ask why the Met is still putting out 24 shows after facing a very large, very obvious financial conundrum. To be fair, there are small steps being made,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-unveils-a-season-of-big-stars-and-6-new-operas.html\" target=\"_blank\"> vague as they may be</a>. The Met has introduced \"Fridays under Forty\", where on select Friday nights, people under 40 can get tickets for $60 or $100. They're also pushing back the curtain times on those nights from 7:30 to 8pm, to accommodate the work hours of under-40s, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-unveils-a-season-of-big-stars-and-6-new-operas.html\" target=\"_blank\">which are apparently longer</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom where I'm sitting, the arts have been learning to adapt to modern cultural and financial climates, and the opera scene is no longer exempt from the task. Younger generations no longer see opera as something to preserve, because they have no personal or cultural connection to it. In short, the standard operas (<em>La boheme, </em><em>La traviata</em>) no longer sell themselves. The Metropolitan Opera's answer to the question of pulling in a new audience is a season full of standard operas, many of which are in revival productions (Zeffirelli's <em>Turandot</em>, for example), with the occasional cheap(ish) Friday night.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I know that a year isn't long enough to roll out major changes in programming, and I get that the Met is under huge pressure from its donors. Perhaps you'll even argue that it's not the role of the Metropolitan Opera to push for the new face of opera, in the same way that<a href=\"http://schmopera.com/in-review-tcherniakovs-don-giovanni/\" target=\"_blank\">I've argued</a> that a function of the Canadian Opera Company is to bring the international opera scene to Toronto. But it no doubt took more than a year for the Met to foresee a decline in younger audiences and precarious donor dependence. I appreciate the big business machine that is the Metropolitan Opera, but I think today's opera lovers are growing wise to the artistic cost.\n</p>",

Gabrielle is a singer and composer; she's a member of the band GABI, and her first opera, _Bodiless_, had its premiere last year at New York's [Roulette](http://roulette.org/about/). \n\nThe question posted was simple: \"How do you deal with making an archaic form accessible?\" \n\nI love Gabrielle's answer so much. \n\n>\"I think in all kinds of music it's a constant question: how to relate to people. Of course you want to connect to people, you don't want to just be in your head—you want to relate to people who are alive now. But with the opera, I just had a vision and I saw it through. Honestly, in New York, I know there's lots of talk about cross-pollination between the different music scenes, and there are definitely certain instances of that, but I do feel that the worlds are pretty separate. The new music/classical world does have some crossover with electronic music, but the worlds feel pretty different to me. In classical music, there are so few opportunities and so many interesting composers. I don't really know how panels work, but from what I've heard they're often kind of random. It's a super hard field. I've always been more interested in carving my own path, anyway, and not fitting into whatever path is laid out for me. I was on track to go to conservatory, but I think it's helpful in this day and age to just do your own thing.\"\n\n[Click here for the full interview](http://noisey.vice.com/blog/gabi-interview-2015), with clips of Gabrielle's work.",

Gabrielle is a singer and composer; she’s a member of the band GABI, and her first opera, Bodiless, had its premiere last year at New York’s Roulette. The question posted was simple: “How do you deal with making an archaic form accessible?”"

        "body": "<p>\n\tWhen I was thinking about pursuing a Doctorate degree in Collaborative Piano, I had a germ of an idea for a thesis project: to create a piano-vocal score of a standard opera (<em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>, or <em>La traviata</em>, for example) that would be designed for pianists who didn't necessarily have a strong operatic background. These scores would be edited so that a pianist could play everything they see, and it wouldn't sound stupid (which is what happens if you play every note you see in, say, a Bärenreiter edition of anything). I came up with the idea after working on my first few operas, and learning to recreate the orchestra at the piano with a combination of scores and recordings. Piano-vocal reductions of opera scores are always either incomplete (missing vital melodic lines), or redundantly difficult (fast passages in thirds, which sound great on two flutes, and pretty terrible on one piano). For more examples, I suggest checking out the PV scores of \"Celeste Aida\", or anything by Richard Strauss.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI thought to myself, it can't be that difficult to write something that will <em>actually</em> sound correct. Schirmer, mark those string tremolos as <em>pianissimo</em>, and the oboe lines as <em>mezzoforte</em>, so that the balance is correct. Bärenreiter, get rid of all the unnecessary octaves that cost a pianist accuracy, and just write a damn legato line. Boosey, stop showing me all the inner lines that no pianist could ever play, and that obscure the bits that are actually important.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI still might come up with the Douglas edition of the Mozart/DaPonte operas, or something, because I feel strongly about this subject. But the real issue isn't that these piano-vocal scores are cryptic, it's that musical notation must be, and has always been, taken with a grain of salt.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428724253039/early-music-notation_Fotor_Collage.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IPaei0MLxTC3D8j8-_xs5VKYpdKEeklNGDhdwxYRersVByotAmK2Rvn2sbE9koKY1i4MxksqUzGFYnvIO8ptLpd1qMq8\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IPaei0MLxTC3D8j8-_xs5VKYpdKEeklNGDhdwxYRersVByotAmK2Rvn2sbE9koKY1i4MxksqUzGFYnvIO8ptLpd1qMq8=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Top: 12th century notation from the Schøyen Collection. Bottom: from George Crumb's <em>Star-Child</em> (1977).</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tI'm not equipped to give you a history lesson in musical notation, but here's the short version: notation started with suggestive dots and lines above the text, showing the reader the intended shape of the melody. This minimal system evolved to accommodate more specific rhythms and keys, and eventually composers could notate the <em>way</em> to play a note, not just which note and for how long. Accents, <em>staccati</em>, slurs, <em>fermate</em>, etc., are now just as commonplace on a page of music as are the notes themselves. But no matter how specific a composer may be, they can't dictate everything.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428724323278/Screen-Shot-2015-02-22-at-2.11.30-PM.png\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pUAfNpJfkmWUH4s1Eb40voxJ1kf_OFjyXKO262RjYPAVVKewvxZZE_58Bawkx8NWh51dwlhkzGg6cnQ-xJkveJpDSgM\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pUAfNpJfkmWUH4s1Eb40voxJ1kf_OFjyXKO262RjYPAVVKewvxZZE_58Bawkx8NWh51dwlhkzGg6cnQ-xJkveJpDSgM=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tThese are the first four bars of Pamina's aria, \"Ach, ich fühl's\", from the manuscript of Mozart's <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>. Look at the beginning of the third measure: two eighth notes, each on a syllable (the last two in the word, \"verschwunden\"). How is a singer really supposed to know that those two eighth notes aren't actually equal? That the first note gets a bit of a lean, and the second note needs to be the release of tension (basically, sung softer and a bit shorter)? Without the context of musical style and the tendencies of the German language, this score doesn't say anything about uneven eighth notes.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428724353434/CheGelida.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xhgl82A7XEQwbXG6Q0gAbW8bNFd2NR0nWXtCGYz_-WcA_JmHKUjKzgRZk_xSJHakTTvCbYuC5pIwe-EoW6BhhmOBbCZM\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xhgl82A7XEQwbXG6Q0gAbW8bNFd2NR0nWXtCGYz_-WcA_JmHKUjKzgRZk_xSJHakTTvCbYuC5pIwe-EoW6BhhmOBbCZM=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tThis famous bit from <em>La bohème </em>is another great example. Puccini sets the text under even eighths once again, and if a tenor actually sang this line as written, I would be concerned. The syllables on the downbeats of Rodolfo's first four bars are the true points of stress in this Italian sentence (che <strong><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">ge</em></strong>lida ma<strong><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">ni</em></strong>na, se la <em><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\">la</strong></em>sci riscal<strong><em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">dar</em></strong>\"), and Puccini made a fair assumption that the language would inform the small differences in stress (rhythm, really) that are almost impossible to notate.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEven when musical notation gets to a level of almost unquestionable clarity, there's still a missing piece. That piece is the performer's being aware of the reason, the significance of the notation. A good example is this moment in Britten's <em>The Turn of the Screw</em>.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428724386022/Screen-Shot-2015-02-22-at-9.50.30-PM-1024x130.png\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a5NavIJDeXOzJ8tPEbHQF5F6ZB8B34Lg_AdFpTL2B7apUG9-OacbFtU4e0DrjiV5yzXUlXQFk2MrNsCguyRnKsfDvePi\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a5NavIJDeXOzJ8tPEbHQF5F6ZB8B34Lg_AdFpTL2B7apUG9-OacbFtU4e0DrjiV5yzXUlXQFk2MrNsCguyRnKsfDvePi=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tPeter Quint is a ghost, haunting a boy named Miles; in this scene, he's trying to lure Miles towards him, or away with him, or wherever ghosts go. It's an incredible scene, and Britten does a pretty damn good job of giving the performer <em>everything</em> he needs. He writes an octave leap for Quint, and puts a <em>diminuendo</em> to <em>pianissimo</em> on the way up, all over \"long sighing\"; a singer can easily see from the notation that the idea is to sing \"long sighing\" in a long, sighing way. That's what I mean when I say the performer needs to be aware of the reason for the notation. It's one thing to do everything on the page, and it's another to understand why it's all on the page to begin with. It reminds me of that George Carlin quote about the playing the blues: \"I'll give you a little tip about the blues, folks: it's not enough to know which notes to play. You need to know why they need to be played.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we're talking about music for singers, the text rules all; when it comes to language and music, one is an extension of the other, and <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/your-musical-self/201209/which-came-first-music-or-language\" target=\"_blank\">there are a few theories</a> about \"which came first.\" The funny thing is, musical notation is a lot like an alphabet. Letters and phonetic symbols notate language with a certain amount of specificity, but no alphabet (not even the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet\" target=\"_blank\">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>) can capture things like inflection or minor variations in pronunciation. Like how the phrase \"don't you\" has a bit of a \"ch\" sound in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you consider how important it is for humans to be able to communicate with each other, I think it's fascinating that it's so difficult to record or represent language. Artists are used to the fact that, on their own, text and music present a lot of questions. When text and music are combined, the list of questions can be significantly smaller. I like this dichotomy, where music and language complete each other, yet still have their own vague corners that can't quite be objectively understood. Those unanswerable questions are what will keep the arts entirely human, and perhaps exempt from our tendency to quantify and define. The limits of musical notation show us exactly where the lines become blurred, where we rely on insinuation and assumption, and where individuality reigns.\n</p>",

Where are they going? We all thought those juicy chords would lead to that high B-flat in the second bar, but Strauss take us for a detour. The harmonies literally transform underneath Zerbinetta's strange, meandering cadenza. By the time that happy little F major chord settles in at the end of \"Verwandlungen,\" we're all baffled by where we've ended up. The first of Zerbinetta's many tricks…<br>\n</p>\n<h2>2. Pagliazzo, Mezzetin, Cavicchio, et al.</h2>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428724715828/IMG_20150220_162813-1024x758.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZczJxoTG00M3UJV2RjWByS0e1d5jObV0n4ABUtoPyjGyQWTdFOtrY2ERjS7oxFA06rUN8KFK-pILmAOB1tye5inLov12yg\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZczJxoTG00M3UJV2RjWByS0e1d5jObV0n4ABUtoPyjGyQWTdFOtrY2ERjS7oxFA06rUN8KFK-pILmAOB1tye5inLov12yg=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tDon Giovanni isn't the only one with a long list of conquests; the nymphomaniacal Zerbinetta starts rattling off her line of lovers, and they all seem to have specific memories attached to their names. Pagliazzo sounds like a comedian, a bundle of energy: look at that cluster of notes over his name, ending upwards, like a raised eyebrow. Mezzetin is next, and he's a much more calculated, clean-cut kind of dude: Zerbinetta says his name with matter-of-factness, almost like Mezzetin had to coach her into the correct pronunciation. Then comes Cavicchio, who somewhat unfairly gets compared to Pagliazzo; but Zerbinetta sings Cavicchio's name higher, and in a more leading harmony. It's as if Zerbinetta had a few \"firsts\" with Cavicchio, and she can't help but remember them well.\n</p>\n<h2>3. \"Launen\" (whim) &amp; \"Müssen\" (need)</h2>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428724754308/IMG_20150220_162841-1024x758.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F5YWdoo2o5zrNLRN-k7Pl2fbK0I0H2K6v0Qt2typZtjUPUiqPrhqaLPCeFoyFdhJ6mZr7nlEynp0aPbTPnS94-fuIh8\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F5YWdoo2o5zrNLRN-k7Pl2fbK0I0H2K6v0Qt2typZtjUPUiqPrhqaLPCeFoyFdhJ6mZr7nlEynp0aPbTPnS94-fuIh8=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tThe word \"Launen\" is the one set to all those accented notes on the left hand side. Zerbinetta actually says \"never a whim\", in reference to the seriousness with which he took up each lover. Those accents are as if she's arguing naysayers on the fly. She moves on to say \"never a whim, always a <em>need</em>\" (ein Müssen!), in a sexy, sexy setting. Look at that octave leap she has, followed by a smeary, falling chromatic scale; it's as if Zerbinetta had no say in what her voice (body) wants. I love how \"Launen\" is set in a defensive way, and \"Müssen\" is much more out-of-body.\n</p>\n<h2>4. \"Nicht versteht\" (not understood)</h2>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428724814585/IMG_20150220_163046-1024x758.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xHNHkRYABt2ss938f1RsT4KosZI5ea4IFcoMH_BSFUlzrgctLk82TzgecG2y4VFIqI-BO8X_8ff8AFO8bxF7mY9jhMZm\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xHNHkRYABt2ss938f1RsT4KosZI5ea4IFcoMH_BSFUlzrgctLk82TzgecG2y4VFIqI-BO8X_8ff8AFO8bxF7mY9jhMZm=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tZerbinetta is in the middle of talking about how she gets swept up by all these lovers and doesn't totally understand why (\"nicht versteht\"). Now, the above cadenza is usually sung on \"ah\", but it still belongs to the words \"nicht versteht\". How better to sing incomprehension than a halting, misguided cadenza like this; sure, it's got direction, but a smart Zerbinetta will figure out how to organize this mess of notes, and in most cases you're left with shorter, broken phrases. I think by the end of this cadenza, Zerbinetta either has a lightbulb moment of self-diagnosis, or she's decided to stop overthinking all the fun she's been having and get on with the song.\n</p>\n<h2>4. \"Hingegeben\" (surrendered)</h2>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428724860521/IMG_20150220_162625-1024x758.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nFWp58cZ7I39C8eiLQsYin3ZMafd7idnl_v_wwcNLdsq6Qoz7FPxrbRIG1fuHKf9prQ4-gdCI1vt2bEKZKHwoQjEHpJN\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nFWp58cZ7I39C8eiLQsYin3ZMafd7idnl_v_wwcNLdsq6Qoz7FPxrbRIG1fuHKf9prQ4-gdCI1vt2bEKZKHwoQjEHpJN=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tThis is one of the hardest passages in Zerbinetta's aria, and we're definitely building towards the grand finish. I love this setting of the word, \"hingegeben\", meaning \"surrendered\", or \"given over to\". The music has stayed relatively tonal, in a recognizable D major for the last couple of pages, and so when the orchestra starts sweeping by with those unexpected, Zerbinetta finds herself at the mercy of one mystery chord after another. She starts the word \"hingegeben\" in unison with the orchestra, and then continues on as if improvising, jamming out to the weird chord progression she can't control. And like textual icing on the cake, she finished this wild phrase with \"war ich stumm\" (\"I was speechless\"). Cute and ironic.\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\tThis week, I'm helping out on a remount production of <em>Semele</em>. I first worked on it in 2012 during my time in the COC Ensemble Studio, and this March, Zhang Huan's <em>Semele</em> is heading to the Brooklyn Academy of Music.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA remount is a weird thing for the artists involved. The sets, costumes, stagings, and (hopefully) the music stay the same, but the casting is rarely identical between productions. This means the newcomers have to insert themselves into the movements of another. This may seem like Acting 101, but the catch comes when the new singer is looking for some motivation for their movements, motivation that's stronger than \"that's what they did the last time\".\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEven the production team work in a strange way, particularly when the director isn't present for the rehearsal period. They look at production notes and archival video footage to verify staging direction, and frequently confer with each other about what happened in that scene the last time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAt a quick glance, it may all feel quite anti-creative, like staging-by-numbers. It's true; this rehearsal method could easily be whittled down to a game of operatic telephone. That's why a remount production can highlight an artist's real skill. When the new Juno wants to know why she crosses left at the big chord, she already knows that the last Juno crossed left; she's really asking for the \"why\" behind the direction. The associate or assistant director has to be armed with answers when the singers ask questions, and give those answers as if they were first-hand information. That means getting to know someone else's piece so well that you have your own opinions to give.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWith the cast, it's neat for me to watch any returning singers adapt their scene to the energy of any newcomers onstage with them. It means they have to be good at listening onstage, which has always been a litmus test of mine when I want to know if a singer can act. The chemistry between the lovers may be different, the villain may be more schizophrenic than evil. Even things like height and weight can read as a totally different facet of the same character, and while new cast members are working on integrating themselves into an existing show, the returning singers are busy throwing out preconceptions of their scene and looking at it with new eyes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere's even the factor of what a role feels like for a singer after some time away. In the case of <em>Semele</em>, it's been close to three years between the production at the COC and the upcoming show at BAM. That's enough time for many singers to move into larger repertoire, or for their instrument to begin sitting higher or lower than before. It's enough time for a singer to have a baby, which changes one's body, and changes one's voice. Pair that with the likely chance of a new conductor, and the musical demands on returning singers are considerable.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile I'm always an advocate of a production in which a director discovers a character alongside the singer, and ironically, I figure it's easier for a singer to adapt to a remount in a production where this doesn't happen. My idealism doesn't quite conform to the reality of the industry, and I fight my urges to bring up the Appeal to Antiquity, how \"because we did it last time\" isn't a solid reason to do anything. But talk about living art: a production and all its parameters can be realized by entirely different groups of people at different times. It takes artists who are dramatically curious, yet free from personal ego, to pull that off. Maybe it shouldn't surprise me that the remount rehearsal that seems robotic makes some of the highest demands on its artists.\n</p>",

The sets, costumes, stagings, and (hopefully) the music stay the same, but the casting is rarely identical between productions. This means the newcomers have to insert themselves into the movements of another. This may seem like Acting 101, but the catch comes when the new singer is looking for some motivation for their movements, motivation that’s stronger than “that’s what they did the last time”."

        "body": "\"How do you do it?\" \"Don't you get tired?\" \"That sounds exhausting!\" \n\nThese are probably the three most common responses when I tell people about what makes up a typical day for me, which looks like this: \n\nUp in the 6:30-7AM range. Commute to Dayjob. 9-5 in the office. Usually an hour break for meals, personal communications and travel, rehearsal from 6-10 or 11 (depending on the contract), commute home around midnight, dinner, ablutions, sleep around 1-2:30AM. Repeat. \n\nYou, my dear readers, know me as an Opera Singer/Critic/Talking Head via the work I do onstage and through various online publications, but there's another side to me. As there is to a remarkable number of your favourite artists on the opera stage in Canada today. That's right. Our day job side. \n\n\"WHAT? You have to have a day job as well?\" \n\nUmm… Yes. Absolutely we do. And here's why… \n\n1) **Unions:** Le sigh. I've never been more torn up about something in my life. Yes, they're great for benefits like Health Coverage, Dental, life insurance, pension plans and all that other deliciously adult stuff. However, I also feel like the existence of the unions seem to force a lot of people into stalled/delayed careers or even kill them altogether. \n\nDon't get me wrong, Like I said, they have their upsides for sure. They protect the artists (anyone doing a community theatre/amateur company production who's lived through at 16-hour tech day understands) so they don't become slaves. That's great. The problem is, once you reach a certain echelon of companies (Canadian Opera Company, Opera Atelier, Pacific Opera Victoria, Toronto Operetta Theatre, et al…) you won't even be considered for anything if you're not a card-carrying member. I've worked in Toronto non-stop for almost 10 years now, across the lyric theatre spectrum, and was only ever offered ONE union opportunity (that was kaiboshed by a company I was in a current contract with). I'm not saying I deserve to be a member either, but I think the community and audience speaks for itself when I'm cast in on average 12 productions a year with some of these companies. Why is this a big deal you say? Let me put it into perspective. When I'm working with an Equity performer (Equity being our stage performers's union), their WEEKLY salary will be more than what I get paid for the WHOLE RUN – rehearsals, tech, and performances, with no option of protection against overtime. I understand the majority of companies are in dire straits with funding, and artist salaries are the biggest cost, but that's a disparity that's not just ridiculous, it's rude and insulting to the non-union performer playing roles just as large and complex as any of your Equity soli. \n\n2) **Audiences:** I love you guys, I really do. But I have to say one thing – you're almost NEVER going to find a Blockbuster production for a $20 ticket. I work in the industry and can't score a ticket that cheap. Ticket prices are probably one of the major detractors from us bringing in an audience. That ticket price is so inflated because to produce an opera is FAR MORE EXPENSIVE than most other live theatre productions. Selling tickets to a _Nozze di Figaro_ or a _La bohème_ is not as difficult as say Verdi's _Otello_. _Otello_ still sells well, but it's a risky flight – and god help you if you program a Handel that isn't _Semele_. The amount of people needed to produce these for you is astounding. I like to think that for every person you see onstage, there are 5 people working invisibly to pull this off. Everyone needs a paycheque, and because we've lost so much in the line of funding (government cutbacks, the death of charitable organizations, and the depleting coffers of the ones that have survived) means that cost can only be made up by ticket prices. \n\n3) **Not-for-profit and charitable organization status** (I may be misinformed on this but this is how I understand it and I'm MORE THAN WELCOME to be corrected): Most companies have to operate in this sector just to survive from year to year. The problem is, that these organizations are somewhat restricted in the types of funding they can chase down. So the lucrative \"Title Sponsor\" position isn't something that can be instated by these companies. That lack of corporate sponsor funding translates directly into reduced budgets and higher ticket costs. \n\n4) **Knowledge** (or lack, thereof): Most people I know can recognize more than one piece of operatic glory. Whether it's \"Largo al Factotum\" and it's \"FIGARO, FIGARO, FIGARO\" etc. _ad nauseum_, or the flower duet from _Lakmé_, or even the Ride of the Valkyries, but they have no idea that they come from operas. Compare this to my European counterparts, who grew up listening to artists like Pavarotti and Caballé on the same city streets as hearing Michael Jackson and Madonna. I love pop music too (Beyoncé is my spirit animal) but I feel our communal lack of education on classical music is what's killing our genre and devaluing current contemporary pop music. \n\n5) **Young Artist/Emerging Artist status:** At exactly what point do I get to just call myself an artist? I'm in my early thirties but I've been onstage for close to 20 some odd years now – yes, I've spent more time on stage/in rehearsal than in a classroom (I did the math). I'm still often classified in the Young Artist category (most probably because I'm currently without representation) which I think is unfair to me and my audiences. I could accept emerging artist, but as a Dora Award Nominee who's been working with professional companies in Toronto alone for close to 8 years now, I feel even that is a bit of a misnomer. No, I'm not a household name, but I'm not the \"new kid on the block\" either. This classification purgatory is stressful. Incredibly stressful. I've seen so many artists with glorious talents and résumés walk away from the stage, because the industry wouldn't look at them as a finished product, now being refined (as they should have), rather than a \"Young Artist\" still learning about their _fach_. Also being in this category is incredibly expensive. These artists are expected to shell out thousands of dollars to do summer programs that, while they can be beneficial, sometimes the stress of the cost outweighs the success of the work in the program. \n\nThat being said, there are a lot of initiatives out there for young artists. Various grants, fellowships, and sponsorships are available, and there's always the fairly lucrative competition circuit (provided you win them, of course) to help ease the burden. They're difficult to obtain and usually buried in kilometres of red tape, but they're there. \n\nBut what will remove this burden? It's time for the old-guard to pass on the torch to the new-guard. Opera can't continue to be produced the way it was in the past and still survive. People want more bang for their buck and the definition of \"bang\" has changed A LOT since 1973\\. At this point, if they want to see a full-on production without breaking the bank, it appears that cheap night at the movies is your only option. \n\nMy advice: go see a new company's production. Even if you know nothing about them/it. Just go! More than likely you'll be pleasantly surprised, your ticket revenue will go where it's needed, and these smaller companies that are working with new business plans will grow and succeed and give the ever-needed jolt to the flatlining industry that is live performance opera. \n\nThen and only then will ALL artists actually get paid enough to live on. \n\n\\*\\*\\* – I grew up in a house that was dependent on a Union and I'm thankful every day for the support the United Mine Workers of America gave to our families on the East Coast as the Coal industry sang it's swan song during my late teens.",

        "body": "<h2>1. Encourage your son/daughter to contact their audition pianist themselves</h2>\n<p>\n\tFrom a practical side, pianists sift through a lot of email conversations, many of which are with people we haven't yet met in person. It's helpful to be communicating with the name that matches the auditionee, instead of talking via a parent, and trying to remember their names as well. It's also a matter of professionalism; if your son or daughter are pursuing post-secondary education in singing, the process of organizing audition details is one of the skills they'll need to learn on their own.\n</p>\n<h2>2. Your son/daughter's pianist thinks their audition is important, too</h2>\n<p>\n\tThis is something I've encountered in my own career. Parents are looking out for their kids, making sure that the pieces of the audition day puzzle fall into place. This can manifest in an attitude directed at the audition pianist, which implies that they can't be trusted with the seriousness of the situation. Within my circle of colleagues, it's a consensus that yes, undergraduate entrance auditions are an important thing. It's in our job description to be on time and play well for our clients, and our experience in playing auditions doesn't mean we take them less seriously; it means we know what the auditionee needs.\n</p>\n<h2>3. Let us have a private rehearsal with our client</h2>\n<p>\n\tYour son/daughter will only get 20-30 minutes of rehearsal time with their pianist, a stranger, before they go in a sing a big audition. I think that time is best spent in a private rehearsal. I've met some singers who prefer to have their parent(s) present for their rehearsal with me, but it's wise to assume that parents will not be in the room. This way, your son/daughter can focus on the task with someone who's unbiased and part of the music scene they want to get into.\n</p>\n<h2>4. We don't know how the audition \"really\" went</h2>\n<p>\n\tIn most cases, the pianist doesn't get to hear anything that the panel says to your son/daughter, since we usually get kicked out of the audition room before the conversation begins. Even so, the audition won't be solely based on how well they sang (grades, available spots, available funding, etc., are also factors), and since an audition pianist probably hadn't heard your son/daughter sing before, they can't really give feedback on \"how they sang\" just now. I wish we could be your personal audition spy, but we're just not that cool.\n</p>",

        "body": "<h2>1. Do your research, <em>then</em> find your pianist</h2>\n<p>\n\tMany music schools have a list of audition pianists, so you should contact the administration and ask for that list. Sometimes you can also find out the plan for scheduling rehearsals before your audition; at the University of Toronto, for example, they generally book you a warm-up room 30 minutes before your audition time. With info like this, you can make sure you hire a qualified pianist, and schedule a rehearsal with them at a time when you'll know you have a room. Finally, ask how much they cost; it's not an obtuse question, and why not find out ahead of time?\n</p>\n<h2>2. It's up to you to show up on time</h2>\n<p>\n\tThe bad news is that most university campuses are pretty confusing to navigate as a visitor. The good news, though, is that Google Maps exists. If you're driving to your audition, decide where you want to park, and be sure to include walking directions from the parking lot to the music building. You're going to be nervous and the day will be hectic; you don't need to add to your stress by getting lost and running late.\n</p>\n<h2>3. Bring your pianist an organized folder</h2>\n<p>\n\tThe ideal situation for your pianist's music is a three-ring binder, with double sided photocopies of your audition repertoire. A singular folder for your pianist is preferable to a stack of original scores, in my own experience; it's lighter, for one, and your pianist won't have to struggle with a book that won't stay open (and perhaps distract you while you're singing). Add your own notes to the music about whether or not you'll take repeats, or sing a cadenza, and it's a great idea to highlight signs for <i>da capo</i>, <em>dal segno</em>, and <i>fine/coda</i>. Bonus points for labeled tabs on each song.\n</p>\n<h2>4. You're in charge of your audition</h2>\n<p>\n\tYour audition pianist may be a total stranger to you, but trust that he or she is there to help you, period. You get a short rehearsal before your audition, so make sure it goes the way you need it to go. Hum a bit of your piece to set a tempo before you start, and if you still don't like it, <em>change it</em>. We will take no offence. There's no requirement to follow your pianist, because we're there to follow you. This goes for in the audition itself; if you need to go slower, faster, take that breath, absolutely do it. Even if you're not perfectly in sync with your pianist for a moment, the people listening to you will know that you've made decisions about how you want to sing your repertoire. That's a good thing.\n</p>\n<h2>5. Pay your pianist before the audition starts</h2>\n<p>\n\tThis isn't a rule that's set in stone, but it's definitely a courtesy that pianists remember. Most auditions start with your singing, and then the pianist is excused while you chat with the panel. The main reason for paying up before your audition is that your pianist may need to run to their next rehearsal, instead of waiting for a cheque while you finish. It's also another thing that you can check off your to-do list for the day. My favourite method is the surprise envelope in the pianist's binder.\n</p>",

        "body": "<h2>What do you call good singing?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI think it's a sense of some amount of effortlessness. When a round resonance is positioned and working optimally, you get \"less is more\", or whatever cliché you want, or \"more bang for your buck\". In the moments that I've been fortunate enough to experience some measure of that…there has been that sense of doing almost nothing. It's a matter of onset, I think, and properly placed resonance, and then everything else sort of takes care of itself, and you're free to focus on communication. That's also a big part of it, when you get offstage and you felt like you were singing well, it often is because you were performing well, and the setup was correct, so you were free to explore that other part of what we do.\n</p>\n<h2>Can you talk about your transition from baritone to tenor?</h2>\n<p>\n\tIt was pretty immediate. There was maybe a month or six weeks of me warming up higher, singing [arias] through, trying to see what my stamina was through. Immediately my stamina was better, because I was functioning in the proper place, and the voice just sort of sat. It had been so muscular and driven down, pressed down, airy and wobbly from tension, because I was below that resonance. When I freed myself, after about a month, it just felt like it sort of sat \"in there\", and it turned where it wanted to turn. I was able to carry the proper resonance down, and integrate the right amount of chest into everything.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf there was going back to zero as a tenor, the acceleration back to something like 60 % was really quick. Even that 60% was so much more healthful than what my 90% had been as a baritone.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>\n\tThere were some people who said \"I think you're a tenor\", but nobody was willing to say, \"you're a tenor and you should switch now\".<br>\n\t\n</blockquote>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\tThe first time I actually sang anything publicly as a tenor was some excerpt pieces from <em>Die schöne</em> <em>Müllerin </em>in the tenor key, which I'd performed as a baritone. I started to well up during one of them, because I'd never felt that freedom of resonance, and ability to communicate with my voice in what I felt was a free and honest way. That was a very moving moment for me as a performer.\n</p>\n<h2>When was the tenor question first posed?</h2>\n<p>\n\tThe suggestion was peppered throughout my first ten years of singing. There was a split camp idea about me. A lot of people thought, \"Oh no, you're a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone#Bariton.2FBaryton-Martin\" target=\"_blank\">Baryton-Martin</a>; you're so sensitive; it's a beautiful sound; for opera, it'll be a specific thing, but you'll do it well; as a recitalist it's so worthwhile\".\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428793847855/KramerRBA-Chris-Hutcheson.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ucj7oR1FB59VY2u8WoBbzaPOIfg86EAAfy0moebq96BQjd0WuSAtjK59HDxoDHxvHqvCUe1emEVgLLoZkgItSUhMVd0\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ucj7oR1FB59VY2u8WoBbzaPOIfg86EAAfy0moebq96BQjd0WuSAtjK59HDxoDHxvHqvCUe1emEVgLLoZkgItSUhMVd0=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Photo: Chris Hutcheson</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tThere were some people who said \"I think you're a tenor\", but nobody was willing to say, \"you're a tenor and you should switch now\". No teachers, no coaches, nobody wanted to be, I think, accountable if it didn't work. That's fair enough; the relationships between a singer and a coach, or a singer and a teacher are delicate things. It's a great deal of trust that has to be given, and I just didn't run into anyone who wanted to take that particular bull by the horns. That was also a valuable lesson for me to learn, that people care, and people are interested, but nobody cares as much as you do. I realized that I was the only one who was going to take ownership of it and do it.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>\n\tI had great concerns about what was happening technically, and I wasn't able to fix them.<br>\n\t\n</blockquote>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\tThere was always the suggestion, and I toyed with it at the last year of my being at the COC Ensemble [Studio], and it just wasn't right. And of course it wasn't right; I was singing the Jailer and Marullo and covering Dandini and singing Sid in <em>Albert Herring</em> or whatever it was. That's what can't happen; it can't happen overnight. You don't have that structure built, that musculature, that muscle memory. You can't just free it up and start singing Tamino. You <em>can</em>scream high Cs, and I was always able to do that as a baritone; but sustaining that <em>tessitura</em>, it's taken me at least a year of re-learning and re-training that musculature.\n</p>\n<h2>What was your process of developing tenor technique?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI finished my time at the Canadian Opera Company, and I found work was getting more inconsistent, and of course that's part of the reality of leaving a young artist programme, too. But also, I had great concerns about what was happening technically, and I wasn't able to fix them, and I had 12 years of experience working technically. No teachers were able to really fix them. My greatest concern was the middle, which, you know, if your middle and your<em>passaggio</em> aren't sounding healthy, there's an issue. But it was wobbly, it was airy, it was out of tune, I couldn't at times fully engage my sound. I only had the option of something colourful and artistic.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI moved home for a summer, and just started re-tooling and singing at a wall. And after four or five months of that I, through that process, talked to my friend Topher Mokrzewski about playing through some things. He was immediately very encouraging about it, and so I screamed at him a few times. The first people to really be supportive of it were <a href=\"http://www.juilliard.edu/faculty/marlena-kleinman-malas?destination=node/19630\" target=\"_blank\">Marlena</a>[Malas], when she was visiting Toronto, who I sang some arias for, and <a href=\"http://schmopera.com/wendy-nielsen-on-teaching-singing/\" target=\"_blank\">Wendy</a> [Nielsen], and<a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2012/08/26/canadian_opera_companys_alexander_neef_hides_in_plain_sight.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander</a> [Neef]. When you have ears like that, and experts of that ilk confirming that you're making the right decision, because it's a scary one to make, that was very helpful in my deciding to continue above and beyond my gut knowledge that clearly this was the right thing.\n</p>\n<h2>Have you met anyone skeptical of your new <em>fach</em>?</h2>\n<p>\n\tNot one. The really encouraging thing is that everybody who's new, who never heard me as a baritone, I've had them say, \"Well, you only made the switch a year ago, and it sounds very natural and right.\" And everybody who I worked with as a baritone and subsequently heard me as a tenor, every single coach, conductor and teacher is like \"Yeah, absolutely\". Alexander [Neef] actually said after hearing me, \"Well, the good news is you're definitely a tenor\".\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have been no nay-sayers in that regard. Lots of people have said, \"Oh, I always knew you were a tenor\".\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt's not just a vocal change, it's a branding change, it's an identity change, the kind of things you're cast for, how you're thought of. Everybody says, \"It's not only a more natural vocalism, but this is how you look, how you seem, it makes sense now.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor more Adrian, follow him on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aitkramer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.\n</p>",

        "body": "<h2>Why do you sing?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI think a big part of the reason I sing is because of my dad's history with singing. He came to Canada as a young, 16-year old Italian immigrant post-war, and ended up taking singing lessons (he had a beautiful tenor voice), with Dr. Vinci, who was also Mary Morrison's teacher, and Lois Marshall's teacher, and Jon Vickers' teacher.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe and my mom used to always go to the opera, and the symphony and the ballet. They took me to <em>Tosca</em> when I was 8, which they later admitted may have been a little much for an 8-year old, what with the murder, the suicide, the jumping off of buildings, and love affairs. But I was addicted from then on.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it started with a love of the theatre more than the music, and that led me into singing. It started with this imaginary play-acting world that I was so enamoured of. I think it grew into a love of theatre and a love of exploring other people, the world from different points of view, especially through the amazing women characters I get to play. Now, at 31, I sing because it feels really good. A lot of the times it's that simple, I'm happy to say. I will always love the theatrical, larger-than-life aspect of it, but it's so gratifying when it's going well, and a note feels like it has infinite potential. That reverberation, physically, emotionally, spiritually, is what keeps me coming back every day, I guess.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOften the people who are coming to the opera for the first time, my friends who I drag but then they love it, I ask what their impressions were, and so much of what I enjoy is someone describing the power that opera can have, and just the power of the human voice, acoustically, can have on someone. And someone who may not have the vocabulary to explain specifically what they mean, they're always able to convey how meaningful it is and how individually it touches them. And that's so cool.\n</p>\n<h2>What do you call good singing?</h2>\n<p>\n\tGood singing to me is well-executed, free, <em>bel canto</em> technique. In my experience, that is what matters to me the most.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that means a sustainable healthy way of singing that follows what the body naturally wants to do, and creates the possibility for stamina and a sustained career arc. More specifically, I talked earlier of a note can have infinite potential, so when I feel I am singing well, or, sometimes, more surprisingly, wonderfully, when I'm in an opera and I can see that it's going well for the singer, I know that they have the ability to improvise, to really express whatever organic impetus may come to them, because their mechanism is free and open, and able to in a split second adjust to their emotional need and their dramatic impulse. The voice is free to respond.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere's a sense that that vibration has the ability to open and relax, and allow the audience to feel and experience what that sound, not just the scene and the costumes and the dramatic situation, but that sound makes them feel things too. That's good singing.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br>\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428794158343/Photo-by-Kelly-Semkiw-1_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oGZeVuq97tFch0O1ZNN7aurgAEFTBLU1itZN-MIFarz_25We18HYUDpHpWY1viQyamfCnTWKSAHnqVv7WnnHPfll9LM\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oGZeVuq97tFch0O1ZNN7aurgAEFTBLU1itZN-MIFarz_25We18HYUDpHpWY1viQyamfCnTWKSAHnqVv7WnnHPfll9LM=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Photo: Kelly Semkiw</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>What do you wish you knew about singing 10 years ago?</h2>\n<p>\n\tIt takes longer than you think. It's a slow, often unrewarding process. Whatever that end point is, short-term or long-term, it requires a lot of alone time, actually. I remember in undergrad thinking \"Oh those poor pianists and violinists, they have to sit in those practice rooms for 6 hours a day.\" And of course physically a singer can't do that, you'll hemorrhage.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt takes longer. Patience: everybody tells you \"patience\", now I understand why. It takes a long time for your voice to start maturing and start doing what you <em>know</em> is in there.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI would want myself to know that you need a really good support system. I'm very fortunate to have that. It's so important in a business that requires that you constantly put yourself up for rejection. Academically, you think you understand that, as a 20-year old, but now, you understand by experience. Having that support system has been invaluable, and so important. A lot of my friends have no interest in the opera world whatsoever, and I think that's actually really healthy. I would tell myself, make sure you have lots of different kinds of friends, singers, non-singers, instrumentalists, accountants, whatever. But then I'd also tell myself to marry a singer, which I will do in a few months!\n</p>\n<h2>What's it like \"crossing over\" from the opera world into other genres?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI think with regard to my varied experience, the most fun I've ever had onstage was in <em>West Side Story</em>. I would love to to more of that, I guess we're calling it \"legit musical\", stuff. I learned really what it is that musical theatre actors, dancers, singers, do every day, and it's astounding. We are such sad little delicate flowers of opera singers, you know, when you see what they're capable of. They're there earlier than everybody, and they leave later than everybody else. I grew as a performer because of that experience, and watching them and their commitment to not only their dancing and singing, but their acting. \"can we try this again\", and they would improv, sort of, not that they would exactly leave the script, but they would really do the scene differently the second time. That kind of freedom was really inspiring to see, and it's actually inspired me to want to work with dancers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of my other projects that's made me grow as an artist has been working with The In-Set. It's Jennifer Nichols, and Justin Di Bernardi, and Tyler Gledhill, and Adrian [Kramer], and myself, and Maika'i Nash as our pianist. We really are inspired by how dance can serve to underscore and highlight emotional highs and lows in vocal music, that perhaps an opera singers, with the demands of our vocal repertoire, can't always do. Bring a new emotional colour or idea that's difficult to express, maybe, with the voice always. Dancers try stuff all the time. \"I don't know, let's just try it\", and it's definitely loosened me up, and it's been fun.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428794198846/Lucia-Maria-in-West-Side-Story-with-Vancouver-Opera-3_Fotor-697x1024.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zhz1naQcalKvksYS0hA4btiLE0nYPamksEQbOHHkKW8v6DVhtDuFU9duffcrWx0fnKRuRMfWvbBroSBTVBdRNtGTPr8\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zhz1naQcalKvksYS0hA4btiLE0nYPamksEQbOHHkKW8v6DVhtDuFU9duffcrWx0fnKRuRMfWvbBroSBTVBdRNtGTPr8=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Lucia Cesaroni (Maria) and Colin Ainsworth (Tony) in Pacific Opera Victoria's <em>West Side Story</em>, 2011.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>What have you learned on the job that you didn't learn in school?</h2>\n<p>\n\tLearning how to produce a concert or a series, etc., is a whole other thing. I think that conservatories and music schools, universities, in whatever guise, do amazing work and I had an excellent experience. But I think there are a few areas that now aren't being taught, that need to be taught, that are maybe only recently relevant. And I think first and foremost is how to be your own producer: how to market the series, how to brand yourself, how to collaborate and network with artists.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWe're put in these streams in school, so you hardly ever see instrumentalists, or the jazz musicians, you know, even those we're in the same building all the time. That's what I've learned, how great it is to be able to genre-bend, and start looking at, whether it's musical theatre or jazz or dance, especially modern dance, I think, works so well with the recital format.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think young musicians really need those skills. I didn't learn it until this point in my career, and I'm glad I did. But I think a course to that effect would be so valuable to young singers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI wonder what would happen if from 18 years old that seed is planted, and a whole generation of musicians from that age see how possible that is, and in fact, how necessary that is.\n</p>\n<h2>What would you do if you didn't sing professionally?</h2>\n<p>\n\tI didn't sing for a year. So, I tried doing other things. I was a fundraiser, I worked in Development with the National Ballet, I worked in PR for a couple of a different organizations, the Toronto Summer Music Festival was one of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tI learned a lot about a lot of different things. I wouldn't do anything else, because I did do other things. I am a singer. Re-choosing it, re-affirming why I want to sing and be a part of this industry was the best decision I've ever made. It's way more fun now, after having lived in other sectors, and experienced day-to-day what that would be like. If you'd asked me a few years ago I would have said, \"Oh, I don't know, probably PR, maybe fundraising.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, it's singing all the way.\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\tPianists, can we talk about page-turning for a minute? Nothing ignites panic in a pianist quite like that horrible feeling of two pages, disguised as one, inexplicably stuck together. The subsequent scuffle between index finger and thumb can escalate into the unthinkable: having to turn the page with <em>both hands</em>. I've never been a fan of having a designated page-turner seated beside me at the piano, because I like my bubble of personal space when I play; my stubbornness on this issue has only grown stronger since I've been playing opera scores. Even neatly reduced piano-vocal scores have aggressively placed page turns, and in those chorus scenes, you're lucky to fit more than eight bars on two pages. To add insult to injury, the number of other people in the rehearsal room who care that frequent page turns can throw off a pianist's groove, is exactly zero.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat can be done? How can a rehearsal pianist handle this kind of multi-tasking while maintaining tempo <em>and</em> their self-respect? Ideally? Learn to memorize like a fiend. I didn't do that, but I did come up with three* simple-yet-handy tips to make your page turns less awful.\n</p>\n<h2>1. Remind Yourself What's Next</h2>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428794795729/IMG_20150212_201156-758x1024.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4O179oJQjZLpP4ZtS0It2-SBd6_3d-juvALR8fyQY5jcsU0AwA4hVG4NjaQ9gpV95alceVWpWz6oolUAciyhrUXi3mZf0Q\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4O179oJQjZLpP4ZtS0It2-SBd6_3d-juvALR8fyQY5jcsU0AwA4hVG4NjaQ9gpV95alceVWpWz6oolUAciyhrUXi3mZf0Q=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tThis photo is from my <em>Peter Grimes</em> vocal score. The page turn happens in the middle of a chorale-type section, where the rhythm is steady and the harmonies are important. This means that leaving out the left or right hand while turning the page is obvious to the point of it being distracting. I wrote myself a mini cheat-sheet of what's just over the page, telling myself that the F major chord in the right hand stays the same over the page, and that there's a G-natural in the bass; I also know that at the top of the next page, the quarter-note chords stop for just enough time to turn. I did the same thing later in <em>Peter Grimes</em>, at the very fast end of one of the Interludes:\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428794823664/IMG_20150212_201243-758x1024.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jLrjgVNdnxLRr8e-G6R7iEzjfIGp4KmCn2NLIBe0Zyd_PGGauGyykPZekqP2RRxE9eUoBEynP2FR_pyybzS0XQbC0eDy8w\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jLrjgVNdnxLRr8e-G6R7iEzjfIGp4KmCn2NLIBe0Zyd_PGGauGyykPZekqP2RRxE9eUoBEynP2FR_pyybzS0XQbC0eDy8w=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tWhat I mean to tell myself here is that just over the page you end loudly in e-flat minor, and the bass drum happens, with some gusto because of the exclamation mark. This little note reminds me that the Interlude is over on the top of the next page, and it leads into a bit of recit with just a rumbling bass drum roll for accompaniment. So, as I tear down this chromatic scale in major ninths, in a constant accelerando, I at least don't have to worry about turning this particular page until after the bass drum, exclamation point.<br>\n</p>\n<h2>2. Get the Job Done Early</h2>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428794937564/IMG_20150212_202516-1024x758.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ua6OM19nXHugx4oTKIUJwy02rn4kwNh_5Ljt89kGdx8StVrjGx3yWfciE-wXdMXE100ELnI_1_fi7vWTrmtH5ykPBPeZ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ua6OM19nXHugx4oTKIUJwy02rn4kwNh_5Ljt89kGdx8StVrjGx3yWfciE-wXdMXE100ELnI_1_fi7vWTrmtH5ykPBPeZ=s1200\"></a></figure>\n<p>\n\tThis is a fun bit in Act II of <em>La bohéme</em>, that's not that difficult to play, but because everyone and their dog are singing in this scene, the page turns just won't quit (you'll note that the above two pages have about ten bars in them, and these bars move quickly). This is the opposite of the <em>Peter Grimes</em> examples: in cases like this, it's better to nip the problem in the bud before it becomes a <em>disastro</em>. Instead of waiting to the last couple of bars to turn, as usual, the smart pianist will see that she can carve two and a bit beats of rest from the left hand after striking that low A-flat. While the right hand does its scale, the left is free to turn the page in peace before Act II ends. As you can see, I like to give myself some forewarning, with the \"turn [page] early\" note, bottom left, followed by \"turn now.\" in the bottom right; it's like a snooze button, but for pianists.<br>\n</p>\n<h2>3.

I was misled by a clickbait-esque headline (not Anne's): <a href=\"http://www.artsjournal.com/2015/02/ian-bostridge-is-not-a-classical-singer-says-anne-midgette.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"'Ian Bostridge Is Not A Classical Singer' Says Anne Midgette\"</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe review itself isn't out of the ordinary. There are, however, some troubling paragraphs:\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>\n\tIan Bostridge is not a classical singer. Yes, he's a tenor, and what he does is vocal performance, and it's strikingly compelling. But classical singers produce sound in a certain way, with a certain kind of vocal support and certain accepted wisdoms about sound and line and diction. Bostridge, by contrast, comes at singing from entirely his own direction and arrives at his own unique conclusions and results.<br>\n\t\n</blockquote>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\tI'm surprised Anne used this argument to basically make the point that she doesn't think he's comparable to Gerald Finley. She'd be hard pressed to find two people who give the same definition of a \"classical singer\". She also seems to be saying Bostridge's autonomy excludes him from the (Anne's) ranks of classical singers. She goes on:\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>\n\tBostridge has a considerable vocal technique to be able to sing \"Winterreise's\" 24 songs and show no more strain in the last song (\"Der Leiermann,\" the organ-grinder) than the first (\"Gute Nacht,\" good night). But his singing comes from his head, in more ways than one. Hearing it, you sense that rather than being supported from the diaphragm, it is controlled from above, on invisible marionette strings, one effect succeeding another as products of an active, slightly gothic imagination, not always entirely connected to his skinny body as it gyrates nervously around the piano.<br>\n\t\n</blockquote>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\tThis is the kind of mean, irrelevant criticism, written by people who do not make music for a living, that today's classical music scene simply does not need. There are broke artists everywhere, and so the concert scene (just like the opera scene) has begun to adapt to the fact that only the creative survive. Basically, a critic should be the first one to notice that individuality is invaluable in today's live entertainment, instead of taking shots at Bostridge's perceived oddities. It feels similar to the cool kids who make fun of the uncool kids for reading books.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe real question that came to mind upon reading Midgette's review is this: if the definitions of classical music performances are changing, shouldn't that extend to the classical singers? If singers train for projection and stamina, isn't it because they're going to sing in a 2000-seat theatre? Wouldn't a savvy artist be adaptable to their performance space, and not sing with all they've got just because they can? Isn't singing supposed to be a heightened form of speech, anyway? Don't singers always strive to <em>communicate</em>, not just \"produce sound\"?\n</p>",

        "body": "<h2>1. How did the connection between the stories of <em>Xerxes</em>and a drag king's love triangle come about?</h2>\n<p>\n\tWe were quite dedicated to producing an opera this season that pushes a bit at the boundaries of traditional stagings. The original score of <em>Xerxes</em> includes a lot of gender bending, whether that is embodied physically or aurally by the voice. The title role was written for a castrato, and Xerxes' brother, Arsamene, was intended to be sung by a soprano. The fiancée of Xerxes, Amastre, was written for a woman, but this woman ends up being disguised as a man for almost the entire opera. And even a manservant, Elviro, dresses up as a woman flower-seller in one scene. It is strange to think that audiences in Handel's time, where gender roles were more rigidly defined than today, likely had an easier time coming to terms with all this confusion than our modern audiences, who have certain expectations of a sound world and physical world matching up. With all of the cross-dressing inherent in the original piece, we decided that this could in fact be what we build on to bring the opera into a more modern context. Our director, <a href=\"http://www.canis-tempus.org/pages/Andy.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Cuk</a>, decided we would not hide all of the cross-dressing in our production, but instead assign the genders of the roles to what they sound like: women. So while the plot remains untouched and the story of love, jealousy, hate and lust still takes place, it now does so in the context of homosexual relationships between women. To make the setting seem even more \"real\" for today's audience, the action takes place in a drag king club in contemporary Montréal, where Xerxes, the bar's owner, rules like \"the King\".\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428795314366/Meagan-Zantingh-headshot.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lpiwwxCkW97AGWPJCGTjbSsJWf326dbTS3wx2W8ixOJvqpmBeF3YrHRt8ccZR1MrQ3wLMjjFapvGRaw51CwJsRKua321qw\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lpiwwxCkW97AGWPJCGTjbSsJWf326dbTS3wx2W8ixOJvqpmBeF3YrHRt8ccZR1MrQ3wLMjjFapvGRaw51CwJsRKua321qw=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Meagan Zantingh, Co-Artistic Director, Opera da Camera</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>2. Why do you think that Handel's operas are so often updated and re-imagined? What artistic allowances do his works allow?</h2>\n<p>\n\tHis operas from the beginning were meant to be relatively flexible, depending on what singers and musicians he had available and what the production budgets were. And even though this opera is technically about the King of Persia, there are almost no historical elements in the plot. The real focus is on the love story and the real emotions of the characters. This makes it easy to set it anywhere.\n</p>\n<h2>3. Opera da Camera is about small venues and audience accessibility. How are these two things linked?</h2>\n<p>\n\tThe stereotype of opera today is that it's an elitist genre where rich people go to watch huge, expensive productions in big theatres. Opera da Camera wants to attract people by making them feel more a part of the action, by letting them see the singers up close. They will notice how the singers work incredibly hard, sweat, breathe, and have facial expressions. There is such power in the human voice, and we believe that the more intimately it can be experienced by the public, the more they will feel the voice and the story resonate within them.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.theatrerialto.ca/en/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rialto Theatre</a>, where we've had the honour of performing these past three years, provides a level of casual comfort that is not usual in a regular theatre. There is cabaret seating and booths; there's a bar with opera-themed drinks; some of the action of the opera will take place in the audience itself. In a way, this allows us to help audiences experience opera more as it would have been common in Handel's time, where the social aspect of meeting up with friends to spend an entertaining evening together was just as important as appreciating the artistic merit of the work presented.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428795364948/Kathrin-Welte-photo.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w412gSPHZ22frF2xz9bb97xv7YZDc_Uqoh9JwC49ltSSPEWFBX3mSYeY6Kgu4IQLd6goesLVBjPEe6amcVERzQJeCPqw\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w412gSPHZ22frF2xz9bb97xv7YZDc_Uqoh9JwC49ltSSPEWFBX3mSYeY6Kgu4IQLd6goesLVBjPEe6amcVERzQJeCPqw=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Kathrin Welte, Co-Artistic Director, Opera da Camera</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>4. How indicative is Opera da Camera of Montréal's opera scene?</h2>\n<p>\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.operademontreal.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Opéra de Montréal</a> is obviously the great establishment in this city, along with its <a href=\"http://www.operademontreal.com/en/emerging-artists/atelier-lyrique\" target=\"_blank\">Atélier Lyrique</a> programme. However, this city is full of gifted emerging artists looking for opportunities to sing roles and be part of exciting productions. In the past few years, there have been other small companies like ours (<a href=\"https://cbmroyal.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Compagnie Baroque Mont Royal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.opera-immediat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Opéra Immédiat</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuandjess\" target=\"_blank\">Stu&amp;Jess Productions</a>), that have realized there is a niche for productions on a smaller scale. And the public, some of whom may not be interested in the grand scale of the Opéra de Montréal, is ready to experience opera on a more intimate level. Opera da Camera is proud to have an audience that is made up of mostly young people and often first-time opera goers. We see ourselves as an important part of the city's operatic ecosystem. If audiences like what they see in our productions, then perhaps they'll try other companies like the Opéra de Montréal…and hopefully this might work vice versa as well!\n</p>\n<h2>5. What are some projects you'd like to see developed by Opera da Camera in future seasons?</h2>\n<p>\n\tFor a long time we've had the dream of experimenting with different venues, venues that aren't necessarily theatres – and continuing to make the space and what it has to offer part of the show. Another important goal would be to collaborate more with other small companies in the country. It takes such effort and financial risk to mount new productions as we do, that it could be hugely beneficial to begin considering joint productions to take off some of the pressure. This is, after all, what many bigger houses do already. Even just two small companies putting together their production budgets would allow for slightly higher production values right from the beginning. But more importantly, both could afford the companies to be a bit more 'artistically risky', by mounting unusual/unconventional productions. The question of going traditional vs modern is a tough one for a small company that relies hugely on the revenue of ticket sales, and therefore needs to appeal to as broad a public as possible.\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\tOut of this season's Free Concert Series in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, <a href=\"http://janearchibald.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Archibald</a>'s recital with Liz Upchurch was one I was really looking forward to. I was by no means disappointed. Jane's is a voice I've admired since I heard her as Zerbinetta in her COC debut in 2011. She was charmingly frank about her limited experience as a recitalist; I noticed that her programme was heavy on standards and perhaps a bit of a safe selection of rep, but all of it suited Jane beautifully. She gave a classy nod to Liz Upchurch at the piano, who has an extensive career of giving recitals, and Jane credited Liz with encouraging her to sing some new stuff alongside her go-to picks.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJane and Liz began with a Mozart concert aria, \"Vorrei spiegarvi, o Dio\" K. 418, which I'd never heard before, but was clearly a piece of technical fireworks, to which Jane is no stranger. It was the kind of aria that demanded a ton from the singer, both technically and musically; there were phrases that trailed off at an impossibly high tessitura, and Jane still found the music in those moments. The aria sounded strangely progressive for Mozart, all chromatic and odd phrase lengths, but it's a winner for me. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUpB_bzrJ8s\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to hear Edita Gruberová sing it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA set of Gabriel Fauré was next on the programme, and although it struck me that I hadn't yet heard Jane sing in French, she chose songs that suited her light legato well. She sang in a beautifully understated way during \"Lydia\", and let her voice fill out for a stunning \"Après un rêve\". Liz played these songs with gorgeous lines playing duets with the voice, and I envied her calm posture while she played that pianist's nightmare, \"Fleur jetée\".\n</p>\n<p>\n\tJane completely shone in her set of Richard Strauss, speaking briefly about the role of Strauss' music in her career. She chose some of his \"hits\", which was entirely fine with me because it's rare to hear any \"hits\" sung with the care that Jane gave. Alongside Liz, Jane sang a perfect \"Ständchen\", all light and secretive and giddy; Liz had a beautiful touch for that tricky piano part, showing off her knack for finding endless colours within a song. \"Morgen\" was a total gem, as performed by these two deeply musical women.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, Jane and Liz gave us four songs by Roger Quilter. I usually have a list of English composers whose music I'd rather hear than Quilter's, but I can't deny that the two of them were perfectly suited to the songs and the style; it was one of those moments where I got to hear professionals sing all the old songs my classmates sang during my university years, except <em>really well done</em>. Jane obviously loved these poems, and Liz didn't miss a moment in Quilter's dense piano scores. It was a beautiful end to the recital, even though we were treated to an encore: \"O Sleep, why dost thou leave me?\" from Handel's <em>Semele (</em>Jane is getting set to reprise the title role Zhang Huan's <em>Semele</em>, seen at the COC in 2012, where she was a superhuman coloratura machine.).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis recital was a great confirmation of my suspicions about Jane: even without the spectacle of sets and costumes, all the great stuff is truly in her voice. The Amphitheatre isn't a place for singers to hide, and Jane was as polished up close as she is on the big stage. Paired with Liz at the piano, this was an expert duo offering a really fine concert. A total treat!\n</p>",

From my own experience with the <a href=\"https://operaramblings.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/quilico-awards-2013/\" target=\"_blank\">2013 Quilico Awards</a>, I know that this intra-Ensemble competition can be tough on the singers.

The Quilico Awards are unique in that the young artist singers compete internally, during some of the most high-paced, high-stakes years of their careers so far. I'm historically terrible at making the call on competitions (I assume if I were a judge on a panel, I'd be the \"difficult\" one). It's even more of a crapshoot when all the singers competing are in the middle of big technical and professional changes. I know the Ensemble Studio singers are a tough bunch, and they don't need my empathy; my heart does go out to them, though, because they're worked hard and competing against your closest colleagues (and probably friends) is hard.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe short version of the story is that three prizes were handed out: Soprano <a href=\"http://karineboucher.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Karine Boucher</a>took first prize, bass-baritone <a href=\"http://www.ariamanagement.com/en/nos-artistes/gordon-bintner-w/\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Bintner</a> took second, and mezzo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/burragec\" target=\"_blank\">Charlotte Burrage</a>won third.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKarine sang with that unique, warm, and consistently beautiful sound that I always love to hear, and her red gown was <em>fab.</em> She started with Marietta's Lied from <em>Die Tote Stadt</em>, but really shone with the judge's next pick, \"Sombre forêt\" from Rossini's <em>Guillaume Tell</em>. I knew Karine could deliver gorgeous sound, but her smooth coloratura took me by surprise.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428796911532/2015-02-09-COC-Quilico-089_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vXRvdRiaHArDfQAudU53C8VoI8bI7x26byawNoV5MD7YZ-ICKObAK384FPF-BMMGx6Rvcuj_EV1yHia2OemNLZO-V0NAjQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vXRvdRiaHArDfQAudU53C8VoI8bI7x26byawNoV5MD7YZ-ICKObAK384FPF-BMMGx6Rvcuj_EV1yHia2OemNLZO-V0NAjQ=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Karine Boucher, soprano, and pianist Michael Shannon. Photo: Chris Hutcheson</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tGordon started with a stoic, calm rendition of the Count's Aria from <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>, and then judges asked for some sustained singing via \"O du, mein holder Abendstern\" from <em>Tannhäuser</em>. I thought the Count was a great choice for him, and I was surprised to see how still Gordon was while he sang; it's a wise decision to let one's technique do the work, especially in competition, and that may have been his plan. I wanted a bit more fire from the Count, but Gordon sang it smart.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCharlotte Burrage opened with Sara's aria from <em>Roberto Devereux</em>, something that's become a staple in her aria list, with good reason. I was glad the judges asked for the Komponist from <em>Ariadne auf Naxos</em> next, because the night needed a little steroid boost amongst all the (beautiful!) <em>bel canto</em>. Charlotte wowed the audience with a fierce top in the Strauss, and I heard signs of a growing voice in the Donizetti. Exciting stuff.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428797238313/2015-02-09-COC-Quilico-145_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B5dnKum7abFHh2cg-1M39Q9DWk4Brd0EqRccrv8IsKvbRxFVIi6kfj7x_WxlqkgbOr2Z2eyEuKkpZxng9Gztlx1h8bF1\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B5dnKum7abFHh2cg-1M39Q9DWk4Brd0EqRccrv8IsKvbRxFVIi6kfj7x_WxlqkgbOr2Z2eyEuKkpZxng9Gztlx1h8bF1=s1200\"></a><figcaption>l-r: Christina Petrowska Quilico, Ontario Arts Foundation Executive Director Alan Walker, with winners Karine Boucher, Gordon Bintner, Charlotte Burrage, and COC General Director Alexander Neef.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tOn top of the judges' call, there were plenty of musical highlights from the Ensemble Studio. Tenor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jfortierlazure\" target=\"_blank\">Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazur</a>e started with one of his go-to arias, \"Vainement, ma bien-aimée\"; the innocent energy about him always gets to me when he sings this aria. Baritone<a href=\"https://twitter.com/clarencefrazer\" target=\"_blank\">Clarence Frazer</a> showed off a pretty solid \"Largo al factotum\", which sounds grounded, all the <em>buffo</em> stuff staying rooted in a calm technique. It bodes well for him in the title role for the Ensemble Studio performance of <em>Il barbiere di Siviglia</em> in May. Bass-baritone Iain MacNeil sang a strong \"Aprite un po' quegl'occhi\" from <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>, which tells me that he'll be juggling Mozart roles for seasons to come. If I have one complaint, it's that soprano <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avivafortunata\" target=\"_blank\">Aviva Fortunata</a> wasn't awarded a prize. Her \"Come in quest'ora bruna\", from <i>Simon Boccanegra</i>, rang through the amphitheatre like nothing we'd heard yet that night, and she gave us opera-sized drama. The judges asked next for \"Non mi dir\" from <em>Don Giovanni</em>, and I think it was this combo of aria and size of voice that was responsible for Aviva's getting passed by for a prize. Frankly, I was wowed by the control in her Mozart, and thought to myself that hearing Aviva sing Donna Anna with an orchestra, instead of a piano, would have been an entirely different story. The Amphitheatre is an immediate, live space, and it's not the kind of space in which Verdi voices train to sing; it lets us hear those voices in a way that's akin to looking at a slide on a microscope. It's fascinating and exposing, but not quite the full picture.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSadly, tenor Andrew Haji was out with the flu, and didn't sing. He had \"Tarquinius does not wait\" from <em>The Rape of Lucretia</em> on his list, and I was eager to hear him sing that.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tKudos are also due to pianists <a href=\"https://twitter.com/szetojenn\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Szeto</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mshanncoaching\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Shannon</a> for playing beautifully all evening.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFor more with the Ensemble Studio, make sure you <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BarberofSeville/EnsembleStudioPerformance.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">grab tickets to their performance of <em>Il barbiere di Siviglia</em></a>, May 15, 2015.\n</p>",

        "body": "<h3>1. Great technique, being a good colleague, and networking are all valuable elements to a professional singer; how does that translate for professional instrumentalists?</h3>\n<p>\n\tObviously, as an instrumentalist you want your playing to be at an extremely high level, so I won't say much about that, BUT it is absolutely not the only piece of the puzzle. I would say \"being a good colleague\" trumps them all. There are a lot of amazing musicians everywhere, but being easy to work with will get you hired over other people every time. Whether it's for chamber performances, solo recitals, or orchestras, I've seen personality hired over ability (when difference in ability is minimal) on many occasions. On the subject of networking, I agree. Networking is a necessary part of this industry, but needs to be to be handled in a tactful way. Networking works best when it comes from a genuine interest in getting to know people without coming across as expecting anything in return. Fostering genuine and long lasting relationships is extremely important in this industry which goes back to the part about being a good colleague. It's a very small world and you never know who you might work with down the line.\n</p>\n<h3>2. What are some of your own tips for young musicians in the professional circuit?</h3>\n<p>\n\tA tip I've been thinking about a lot over the past couple of years is that young musicians need to take time in the day to focus on the business aspect of their music career. Whether that is updating their resume, getting new headshots, putting a press kit together, having coffee with a mentor, or thinking about programming possibilities, all of these aspects are necessary on a regular basis for succeeding as a musician in addition to practicing. Many young musicians are caught when they need these items and they are not ready, and then lose opportunities as a result. Innovative and interesting programming ideas are very important when trying to get booked for a solo or chamber recital by a presenter. Presenters of concerts are eager to find musicians who come to them with fully formed programs so that they can judge whether you might be a good fit for their series' audience and also so that they can market the concert properly. Lots of young musicians want to be engaged by presenters, and the more prepared you are, the more likely you'll be chosen to play on their series. If all goes well, then you will probably be reengaged in future seasons.\n</p>\n<h3>3. What are some surprises that young artists encounter about the industry once they leave school?</h3>\n<p>\n\tThere are lots of tough parts about finding your way as a professional musician after school. The parts that were hardest for me for not necessarily surprises, but they were issues that I hadn't totally prepared myself for. Having time and a place to practice was an issue that came up right away. I began to rent a studio that I paid for monthly, which was a new cost for me. I ended up having to work more at my part-time jobs in order to afford the extra cost of the studio, but that also meant less time to practice as a result. I had to work more to practice less, which meant my practicing had to be that much more efficient.<br>\n\tI think a lot of young musicians are unsure how to get work when they leave school. Some will be fortunate enough to win a position with an orchestra, but others will be freelancers, soloists, and chamber musicians who will have to actively seek out work. From my personal experience and from managing other artists, it's best to be versatile. The talented and smart young musicians who are succeeding in Canada are artists who really \"get \" the current environment and diversify by going to conferences across the country and showcasing themselves as classical soloists or chamber groups to presenters in addition to subbing in orchestras or accompanying other musicians. This combination of work can be very artistically satisfying and financially successful. A surprising number of young musicians are not aware of the showcase circuit and the amount of work you can get from it. Canada has some amazing touring organizations like Prairie Debut, Debut Atlantic, and Jeunesses Musicales, that can really help launch the careers of young Canadian musicians. In order to apply for most of these organizations you need to have press kit and programming material ready, which goes back to my advice in number 2 about having that always up to date.<br>\n\tOverall, Canada's classical music job market is not all doom and gloom. There are a lot of opportunities out there for professional level work, it's just a matter of being aware of how to access them. Those who are open to change and are willing to put the work into building relationships and using the resources that are available to them will have the best chance at succeeding in the current climate of non-popular music in Canada.\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\tIn the last few weeks, a recurring topic has come up among my artist friends. The crux of the issue can actually be boiled down to one question: are you still an artist if you can't survive on your artist income?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe answer is easy: yes. I don't know any professional artists who would say that a singer with a serving job isn't a singer. The problem is, <em>some </em>artists would draw conclusions about the skill level of that singer with a part-time job. It might be an innocent, uninformed assumption, that it's safe to bet on the abilities of the fully employed singer than those of the partly employed, because if you're \"good\", you earn more money than those who aren't \"good\".\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you're an artist, you're probably rolling your eyes at the leaps in logic I just made. Skill doesn't correlate to income, you argue, and you're right. If only I had a dime for all the singers I've seen onstage who a) thrill me and b) could use more work; they'd probably match the dimes I had for the singers with packed schedules and decent income who don't move me at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, it's true that an artist who trains for years, only to find inspiration-sucking hurdles in the professional world, takes a bit of an ego hit. There's an assumption that if they had better technique or a better work ethic or more <em>je ne sais quoi</em>, it would be much easier to make a living from their art. These same artists are reasonably aware of the fact that auditions are subjective, companies have fluctuating funds, and the arts has rarely been known to be a lucrative industry in which to work. The reality of the situation doesn't help with that ego hit, though; I've seen this myself, in the current opera scene.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I interviewed Chris Enns about his new personal finance blog for artists, <a href=\"http://www.ragstoreasonable.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rags To Reasonable</a>, he brought up a good point that I'll attempt to paraphrase. Like me, Chris started his musical studies with a piano teacher, an elderly lady who was teaching piano lessons for extra cash on the side. Wasn't she an artist? Did she make us artists? My first piano teacher was a retired high school math teacher (who actually taught my dad, believe it or not), who turned out to have incredible connections and foresight into this world of music. She earned an income from teaching, but her family hadn't lived on it exclusively by any means. At no time did I think of this fact and lose respect for her, or lose my will to learn from her. I think most of my pianist (and otherwise) friends would agree that she is an Artist.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, why don't younger artists apply this reasoning to themselves? I'll tell you. In the opera world, training typically happens in a university or conservatory, and we bridge the time between semesters by doing summer programs. This means that for four to six years or more, we're gifted performance opportunities; operas are produced by our school or The Banff Centre or Opera NUOVA. Some of us even get a few more years of (paid!) stage time and training, in a young artist programme at a professional company. Once we leave, the crickets happen. The enormous amount of work kicks in, and the income dwindles. Artists know this phase well; some look back on it with fond hindsight, and others are living it right now. For the latter group, they're all wondering, \"shouldn't this part be over by now?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis takes us to the crisis moment, where things like stable income, less travel, predictable work hours, less rejection, and family start to look appealing, perhaps for the first time in an artist's life. Maybe they've met a person with whom they want to share their life. Maybe they really want kids. Another, more ubiquitous option: being a professional artist is really, really hard.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps to someone who isn't an artist, this is all less of a crisis and more of an obvious decision. You want to get married? Get married! Have kids? Have kids! Your career isn't really working out? Try something new!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what of the loss? What if a soprano gets pregnant, and despite all her good post-baby intentions, doesn't ever quite make it back to singing? What if the new job you take to supplement your income doesn't let you take enough time off for auditions or gigs? What if everyone finds out you're not throwing your whole self into singing/playing/painting/photography, and realizes you're not a \"professional\"?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAh, so we've returned to the question. For your artist status to move (or remain) to that of \"amateur\", that belittles your hard work, and it can belittle you. The difference between professional and amateur artists is money earned, and, consciously or not, that can insinuate a difference between \"work\" and \"hobby\", between \"good\" and \"not so good\".\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAny time I write something about the arts that I'm convinced is unique to the arts, it never really is. I'm going to get into this topic a bit more in the future, because I think there's a responsibility amongst artists to recognize what the arts industry really looks like. I also think there's a responsibility to avoid artistic martyrdom, and to avoid stereotypes of starving artists. Just like that constant question of the relevance of art forms like opera, the solution is in the general public, not amongst the artists themselves. Think about it: if a singer works as a barista, he may be hesitant to admit that amongst a rehearsal rooms of \"real professionals\". But if a coffee-lover finds out his barista is an <em>opera singer</em>? How cool of a barista are you? They <em>wish</em> they could sing on the stage, let alone rock latte art.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSee the difference?\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\tLast night I finally got the chance to satisfy my curiosity, by seeing the <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DieWalkure.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Opera Company's current production of <i>Die Walküre</i></a>, directed by Atom Egoyan (and running until Feb. 22). Since the 2014/15 season was announced, I had been eager to see Egoyan's take on Wagner, and to hear <a href=\"http://www.christinegoerke.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christine Goerke</a> as Brünnhilde. The women singing the Valkyries themselves included a few friends and colleagues of mine, which always adds a new level of anticipation. I missed the earlier runs of this production, in 2004 and 2006, making me feel slightly out of some <em>Ring Cycle</em> loop. Maybe it's surprising that Wagner isn't my go-to choice for opera listening, but I've learned never to doubt the mesmerizing effect on me. <em>Die Walküre</em> certainly drew me in; now that I'm one quarter into the <em>Ring Cycle</em> loop, I kind of can't wait to see <em>Siegfried</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Brünnhilde, <a href=\"http://www.christinegoerke.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christine Goerke</a> was an obvious standout performance. She had a grounded, steely sound that was still agile and light on the top. Her first entrance, with those fantastic \"ho-ho-to-ho\" cries gave me shivers; her entire first scene was sung with such confident energy that it gave her almost spunky strength. Christine was an incredibly sympathetic Brünnhilde, which, in a female character is hard to balance with such power.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428799021232/Walkure-MC-1138_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2ujXxdaZyM7KLgYtUeB9wc73saz-dxaF6zO3iXKSk_uAHOCGa03K0W0QsJFrWCjhPQigJ4eNyXrwalCq9rAUtdrHTJNB\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2ujXxdaZyM7KLgYtUeB9wc73saz-dxaF6zO3iXKSk_uAHOCGa03K0W0QsJFrWCjhPQigJ4eNyXrwalCq9rAUtdrHTJNB=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Christine Goerke (Brünnhilde) and Clifton Forbis (Siegmung). Photo: Michael Cooper</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Reuter\" target=\"_blank\">Johan Reuter</a> as Wotan was another deeply moving performance. He sang with an open and frank sound that held gorgeous power, and he had a gorgeous, dark tone in his low register. Johan was a notable actor, too; ironically, his Wotan was one of the most human characters onstage. His struggles with duty and responsibility were incredibly real, and led towards Wotan's final moments with Brünnhilde. Johan sings that final scene so, <em>so</em>beautifully. Together, Johan and Christine created a picture of love and respect between Wotan and his daughter.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.heidimeltonsoprano.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Heidi Melton</a> was touching as Sieglinde. She sang an enormous arc of colour, starting with frightened, shy small talk with Siegmund, and ending with an enormously thrilling final scene with Brünnhilde. I thought her voice sounded clear and easy, with a great mix of fragility and personality. Heidi sang a little wildly at the larger emotional spikes throughout the show, but it was always backed by solid singing of a role she knows very well. She also made beautiful use of the German language, I noticed.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428799184929/Walkure-MC-1004_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a2t4lzaZ92nLySYpJUIKohqHZMwE5DF7tPlHVFTlnzqcW6TMD5Df8CdN4bcUNVUHWbOJ3-Ngn2tJprHpW6I7Na0O0uNmUQ\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a2t4lzaZ92nLySYpJUIKohqHZMwE5DF7tPlHVFTlnzqcW6TMD5Df8CdN4bcUNVUHWbOJ3-Ngn2tJprHpW6I7Na0O0uNmUQ=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Clifton Forbis (Siegmund) and Heidi Melton (Sieglinde). Photo: Michael Cooper</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tPrior to downbeat, an announcement was made that tenor <a href=\"http://www.cami.com/?webid=157\" target=\"_blank\">Clifton Forbis</a> was feeling under the weather, but would still the role of Siegmund. I don't know Clifton's voice, and so I can't compare to his healthy sound, but I'll attest to his singing some of the most musically exciting moments of the night. I might have heard signs of Clifton's not feeling 100% in Act I, where the role had more call for <em>sprechstimme</em> and his sound was a bit heavy. His heroic and desperate singing in Act II really grabbed me, though, with his metallic sound that seemed to grow larger without limit.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Sieglinde's mean husband, Hunding, <a href=\"http://dimitry-ivashchenko.de/Dimitry_Ivashchenko/Willkommen_Welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dimitry Ivashchenko </a>sounded like a cannon, exactly what you want with this character. When he sang, he sounded immediately menacing and cruel. Cruelty aside, he still sang with exciting ring, making me want to hear him as a less-bad guy. As Fricka, Wotan's wife, <a href=\"http://www.janinabaechle.com/?page_id=481\" target=\"_blank\">Janina Baechle</a> was fantastic. She had a voice to match her strong presence, and I believed that she could convince Wotan to change his mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt never fails: the Act III entrance of the Valkyries gave me instant goosebumps. The terrifying music got my heart rate up, and one by one the eight singers got me more and more giddy. Soprano <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avivafortunata\" target=\"_blank\">Aviva Fortunata</a>, as Helmwige, started off the \"ho-jo-to-ho\" sequence with what were the most solid and satisfying octaves I've ever heard sung. It didn't stop as<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rihabchaieb\" target=\"_blank\">Rihab Chaieb</a> (Waltraute), <a href=\"http://www.lindsayammann.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lindsay Ammann</a> (Schwertleite), <a href=\"http://www.monasomm.com/biographie/\" target=\"_blank\">Mona Somm</a> (Ortlinde), Laura Tucker (Siegrune), <a href=\"http://deanartists.com/artist/megan-latham/\" target=\"_blank\">Megan Latham</a> (Rossweisse) and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/burragec\" target=\"_blank\">Charlotte Burrage</a> (Grimgerde) piled onstage in hot dresses and big boots. Musically, it was full of gonads (ironically, I guess), and these Valkyries both intimidated me and made me want to be their friend. All the Valkyries were fantastic at establishing their strong, sisterly bond between each other, earning our sympathy when they were asked to disobey Wotan and protect Brünnhilde. They all deserve credit for negotiating a sketchy-looking set, with long dress trains, carrying dead bodies and fire. Brave, ladies.\n</p>\n<figure data-type=\"image\"><a href=\"/webhook-uploads/1428799233371/Walkure-MC-0127_Fotor_Fotor.jpg\"><img data-resize-src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kHcS1fPui7Mdfbk9rupCnVvo4bXdgCGoCSIxB4xTrpTMsfSdf2ItZU9m_hI3aRodLUILU79XI55x7O31CXjG_LNHynjYWA\" src=\"http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kHcS1fPui7Mdfbk9rupCnVvo4bXdgCGoCSIxB4xTrpTMsfSdf2ItZU9m_hI3aRodLUILU79XI55x7O31CXjG_LNHynjYWA=s1200\"></a><figcaption>Dimitry Ivashchenko (Hunding) and Heidi Melton (Sieglinde)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>\n\tThe COC Orchestra under Music Director <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/Orchestra/JohannesDebus.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Johannes Debus</a> played thrillingly all night, starting with those relentless and throbbing tremolos, and finishing with my beloved Ring of Fire music. The orchestra played as one when necessary, and as a chamber group of soloists at other times. I couldn't stop looking at the crowded pit and all the novelty instruments (four Wagner tubas!), and I got a small sense of the hugeness that is this score. In other exciting news, maestro Debus became a father for the first time, just hours before conducting <em>Die Walküre</em>. Congratulations, maestro! #Champ.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe production was all about lighting. There was a single set, designed by <a href=\"http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/michael-levine/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Levine</a>, very post-apocalypse and vaguely meta. I was a little worried by the consistent darkness and static staging in Act I, but when I saw the first major shift in lighting, I realized how versatile the singular set really was. <a href=\"http://www.dfinndesign.com/www.dfinndesign.com/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">David Finn</a>'s lighting design created different worlds for mortals and gods, bringing the two together wisely when the worlds intersected (a bright spot on the Siegfried's sword, embedded in the tree). As for the static staging, I do always wonder with Wagner if more can be done with all that glorious music between lines of text. I understand that the orchestra's role is a spectacle in itself when it comes to Wagner, and the COC Orchestra and its open pit certainly did that last night. Wagner's music is so film-like at times, definitely with a slow pace, but there were moments where I thought the music specifically called for a character to move, or react.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDetails aside, I was still dragged into the story, and I found myself mesmerized by the pacing of the piece. This <em>Die Walküre</em> confirms once again that Wagner just kind of gets you, whether you like it or not. <em>Die Walküre </em>runs until February 22nd; <a href=\"http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/DieWalkure.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">click here for details and tickets</a>.\n</p>",

        "body": "##Why was Béatrice et Bénédict an appealing choice for MYO’s 2014/15 season?\n\nI have a mini-checklist that I use each season to help guide programming, so this is always a big factor. For instance, I always look for a show with 8 singers or less, and one that can reasonably be performed without chorus or piano, among others. *Béatrice & Bénédict* met all of these requirements, but more than that, it's a big of a pet project of mine. *B&B* was my first show out of university, and I performed Héro with Opera NUOVA back in 2010. I fell in love with the show that summer, and ever since I founded MYOpera, I knew I wanted to mount this beautiful opera. The music is stunning, the story sparkles, and the singing is a reasonable, surmountable challenge for the cast.\n\n##What do Shakespeare and Berlioz say about relationships between men & women with this story?\n\nI think this story is especially lovely because it shows a real spectrum of romantic relationships. Héro and Claudio is a traditional sort of pairing that we often see in literature. However, the beautiful thing about Béatrice & Bénedict is that we see a very different type of relationship in them. These two characters are intensely combative and fiercely independent, yet they find a space in their environment where they can be together and find love. This is a really contemporary take on male/female relationships, and it reminds us, that a loving relationship can take any form.\n\n##How is a show like B&B (the characters, their particular relationship) relevant to audiences today?\n\nFor me, the relevance comes from the complexity of the characters' personalities and relationships. Two-dimensional characters are relatable enough, but they ultimately leave today's viewer behind. To see these complex, diverse characters onstage will hopefully remind the audience that these are real, relatable people whose relationship drama is really not that far from ours.\n\n##What do you, personally, like most about B&B?\n\nFor me, it's all about the music in this show. The harmonies and textures are such a huge part of the score, and they serve a dual purpose of embodying the character development while also sounding absolutely stunning. I remember when I first sang the show, I fell in love with all of the music, and mounting it with MYOpera this season has made me fall in love with it all over again. There's a perfect balance of stunning melody, dense harmony, and vocal fireworks, and I feel like I could listen *B&B* every day.",

        "body": "I'm by no means the first to weigh in on the Toronto Symphony Orchestra's decision to cancel Ukrainian-born pianist Valentina Lisitsa's performances on April 8-9th. The decision came after the TSO was made aware of some crass tweets on Lisitsa's Twitter feed, and after they confirmed that Lisitsa was indeed the author of the controversial comments, they made the quick decision to cancel. \n\nShortly after the media flurry began, Lisitsa [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ValLisitsa/status/586315722650951681/photo/1) that she had found a new location for the cancelled performance, at Lawrence Park Community Church. In a weird exchange, the minister of the LPCC, [Dr. John Suk](https://twitter.com/DrJohnSuk), tweeted back:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ValLisitsa\">@ValLisitsa</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LPCCtoronto\">@LPCCtoronto</a> LPCC did not grant permission for this performance. It isn&#39;t happening. This is in error. John Suk, Minister</p>&mdash; John Suk (@DrJohnSuk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrJohnSuk/status/586370713751261184\">April 10, 2015</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nLisita asked if the LPCC had been threatened into cancelling her performance, and Suk said no. Lisitsa fans proceeded to call him a liar. I'm not sure what kind of miscommunication went on between them, but the exchange added to my general distrust of the censored-artist spin on this story.\n\nThe brunt of the frustration over Lisitsa's cancelled concerts fell upon Torontonian pianist Stewart Goodyear, who agreed to step in on short notice to perform Rachmaninoff's 2nd Piano Concerto. Shortly after the news broke, Goodyear was [forced to turn](http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/replacement-pianist-bullied-into-not-performing-after-tso-drops-original-artist-over-tweets-1.3024532) down the concert after Lisitsa's fans loudly opposed his performance. He writes on his Facebook page: \"[Lisitsa's] most recent 'plea' to her fans and followers to attack the orchestra that released her of her performance schedule was unfortunate. Free speech has consequences, and one most own one's position. Dragging other people who have nothing to do with her position does nothing constructive. Her attitude, and the mob-like behavior of her devotees, censored Rachmaninoff's second concerto. It is no longer on this week's program.\"\n\nSo, this is all frustrating. There is quite a bit already written in support of Lisitsa, condemning the TSO's decision to cancel her performance. There is talk of pressure by donors, which Lisitsa claims is true, but which TSO CEO Jeff Melanson [says](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2015/04/08/interview-toronto-symphony-ceo-jeff-melanson-breaks-his-silence/) \"is complete fabrication, and she is basically distorting the truth and making this up. We did not cave to pressure by one lobby group over another, and we absolutely are not taking a position politically between Russia and the Ukraine.\" \n\nOn the topic of donor influence, my hunch is that the truth lies somewhere in the hazy middle ground between Lisitsa's and Melanson's accounts. I'm more interested in all the talk about [freedom of speech](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/columnists/why-the-tso-set-a-terrible-precedent-by-barring-pianist-valentina-lisitsa/article23845288/), and the censoring of political opinions.\n\nThe thing about free speech is that it works in all directions. I have free speech, you have free speech, we all get to say our opinions and that's a protected right we have. But that doesn't mean that what we say doesn't have a ripple effect. \n\nLisitsa voiced her opinions on the Ukrainian government, and the TSO, passively as it may have been, voiced their opinions on her opinions. I think it's an important detail that the TSO never questioned paying Lisitsa as per their contract. They're not saying that she hasn't done an exceptional amount of work in preparation for her performance, or that she's no longer valuable as an artist for expressing her ideas.\n\nThe TSO is dissociating themselves from Lisitsa's opinions. That may seem weak, lame, or passive; it does suggest that there's more to it than the public will get to know. I don't think we can honestly ignore that it's not just about voicing unpopular decisions; *how* they're voiced is not negligible. Lisitsa seems to think that she's tweeting with wit, stating on her Facebook page, \"...satire and hyperbole are the best literature tools to combat the lies.\" \n\nCourtesy of Musical Toronto, you can find a collection of Lisitsa's more questionable tweets [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61455732/Lisitsa_Social_Media_Posts.pdf) (PDF password: MusicalToronto). Frankly, Lisitsa's tweets were shortsighted and un-witty. She pulled the Nazi card, the goverment-pig card, and the gross card; she used oversimplified memes and photos to explain what I hope she understands are complicated issues surrounding the Ukrainian government. This isn't satire; even if her opinions hold some truth, she presented herself immaturely and without foresight online.\n\nLike I said, the right to free speech doesn't mean no one gets to disagree, and when we're talking about online, it certainly doesn't mean there won't be a public reaction. Lisitsa makes good use of her online presence as a pianist, particularly on her [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ValentinaLisitsa). She doesn't separate her personal and professional on social media, and yet by arguing that her political views (personal) are unrelated to her playing (professional), she asks her audiences to draw the line in the sand. I feel badly for Stewart Goodyear, who caught the brunt end of the mob-like reactions to his stepping in. On that topic, I pose this question to Lisita and her supporters: since your political opinions aren’t allowed to be considered in order for her to play, any perceived opinions of Goodyear’s should be irrelevant, too, right?\n\nI think this story of perceived artist censorship is really a story about how artists represent themselves. There's nothing anyone can do about what someone thinks about what we say. It doesn't mean we have to censor ourselves, but we do have to be able to either back up our online footprint, or absorb the ensuing criticism. Lisitsa is arguably a public figure, and she has used that to her professional advantage. Like it or not, her audiences are the same when she's tweeting about politics. Even if a disgruntled donor kicked this whole thing off, it's a realistic part of what it means to speak online. I'm not politically wise enough to judge Lisitsa's opinions, but I don't blame the TSO for distancing itself from them.\n\n",

        "body": "In the West, one of our ongoing cultural discussions is the divide (which seems to grow wider) between audiences of Classical music and popular music. I had always vaguely wondered if this perceived divide exists elsewhere in the world, or if it was unique to Europe and North America. \n\nI had the chance to meet journalist [Aparita Bhandari](http://www.aparita.com/), who inadvertently reminded me of the topic; in the context of a larger conversation, she referred quickly to the difference between Indian Classical music and the popularity of Bollywood songs. Bhandari began her journalistic work in New Delhi, and moved to Toronto in 1998. I thought she would be a great person to ask about the difference between the role of Classical music in Indian culture, versus Western Classical traditions.\n\nIt's important to note that to North Americans, European Classical music is something that's already once removed, culturally speaking. I wondered if it was different in India, where both the art music and popular music are fostered in the same place.\n\nBhandari senses that, in Western culture, the separation between Classical and popular music is stronger, \"whearas in India I think it's a bit more fluid.\" In terms of the musicians, often popular singers or players are Classically trained, and there's a nod to these roots in their music. \"It’s still seen as something one aspires to learn, because a lot of popular Indian music finds its basis in Classical music.\"\n\nThere's also a fair amount of fusion, combining Classical elements with popular music, including from the West. \"A lot of Classical musicians...they take things like the tabla and do fun things with it….putting electronic music over it, that type of thing.\"\n\nI wondered if things like age, education, and social class had anything to do with Classical music audiences in India. \"The appreciation of this tends to cut across class,\" says Bhandari, explaining that it has more to do with a connection to the church. \"Because a lot of Indian Classical music is associated with devotional music, a lot of Classical musicians will have devotional songs in their repertoire.\"\n\nIt's an interesting parallel with Western Classical music; I sense that it's similar to the popularity of a piece like Handel's *Messiah*, which fills churches with people who may not otherwise be concert-goers.\n\nWhen it comes to the age question, Bhandari assures me that it's the same story across the globe. \"It tends to be people who are older who will appreciate [Classical music] more than the younger population, where there’s Bollywood, Indian popular music. And popular music these days also takes in elements of Western popular music, so now there’s hip hop...that type of thing.\"\n\nThe closer connection between popular and Classical music was interesting to me, and I asked Bhandari how it applied to kids and music education. \"There is a sense that it plays into their education,\" she says. \"If you have piano lessons, it might help you with math. That sort of thing is known.\" \n\nParents do value the education, but perhaps not the professional pursuit of music. \"When we think of education, it tends to be very academic-oriented, you learn your math and science. The music is like a nice after-school hobby to have, it’s not something you would take on as a career.\"\n\nThat certainly sounds familiar. Bhandari adds that music education is a way to teach kids about their heritage, especially in Indian families living in Europe or North America. \"You can have your average life at school, but Sunday you’re gonna have Classical Hindustani music class, or Classical Indian dance class, and that will teach you culture, that will teach you respect, that will teach you about your heritage.\"\n\nThe simple answer is that a child's exposure to music, Classical or otherwise, depends largely on the parents' appreciation for it. Bhandari explains, \"it tends to be more if there’s a general interest in the family, if you come from a family of appreciators of culture, appreciators of Classical music.\"\n\nThese Classical music appreciators may or may not be in greater numbers in India than they are in North America. Regardless, the cultural connection to music is like a bonus when it comes to music education; when it comes to finding a reason to give a kid music lessons, I'm not too picky about which one convinces parents.\n\nThat link to our heritage isn't quite the same in the West. Like I said before, to North Americans, Western Classical music is an adopted cultural element. When we enrol our kids in music class, it's not generally associated with a reaching out to our roots. The connection may be closer in Europe (Italy's tradition of opera is a good example), although I don't sense the same amount of reciprocity between Western Classical and pop music.\n\nI think it's interesting to see what the West has in common with India's Classical and popular music scenes. Even more interesting are the differences, which lie largely in the realm of music's cultural significance. The closeness of Indian music and heritage, in a sense, highlights the fact that as North Americans, our cultural connection to Western Classical music is comparatively diffused.

        "body": "Whether you are just learning your first role or seasoning your role-learning technique, this guide is intended to help you with learning an operatic role as efficiently and painlessly as possible. I hope that you will share with me any tips and tricks that I have not mentioned here. Not only will it be helpful to my readers, it just so happens that I am learning a role right now myself! I will use the role I’m covering, Prince Orlofsky from Johann Strauss’ *Die Fledermaus*, as my guide for this tutorial. \n\n##1. Organize your score \n\nThere is nothing more frustrating and detrimental to the learning process than having to backtrack. That is why my role-learning process aims to minimize this as much as possible. It all begins with organizing your score. What does that mean exactly? \n\n####Get the right score\n\n\nNothing will help your process more than obtaining the right edition of the score. If you don’t, your page numbers, cut marks, and perhaps even notes and words could be all wrong. Make sure that you find out from the musical director which edition of the score your production will be using. If you are learning a role for your own preparation, do some research and ask around to find out what the best edition of the opera exists. For example, if you are learning Mozart and can afford to shell out the money for a Bärenreiter, do it. Notice the clean lines that are easily erasable, and the VI- on the top left. A -DE will appear at the end of the cut. \n\n####Put in your cuts\n\nBe sure to ask the director for any music they may cut from the score as well. Oftentimes the cuts will be organized by page number, then staff number, and finally measure number (to look like this: p/s/m). For example, for *Fledermaus*, we have a cut from 49/3/1 to 51/2/6\\. Once you have that information, mark it clearly but sparsely in your score as pictured below. The idea behind this is if and when you perform this role again, you can easily erase previous cuts. Be sure to begin and end your cut with VI-DE (I am unclear as to why it is notated that way; if any of my readers know, please comment below!).\n\n####Tab your score\n\nThere are a wide variety of ways you can tab your score. Some people tab everything while others only tab the exact moment their character enters. I personally like to tab the beginning of a scene number I’m in as that seems to be how rehearsals are normally called. It really depends on what is most helpful to you and the role. As a bare minimum, you will want tabs for your musical entrances.\n\n####Mark your part\n\nSome people will highlight their entire line. I prefer to highlight only my character’s name. I especially recommend this if there’s any chance that you might play a different character in the same opera someday so that your previous marks are not too distracting. \n\n##2. Organize your musical learning process\n\nYou’ve organized your score - great! Now it will be that much easier to figure out what you need to learn in what order. I tend to break my learning down like this. \n\n####Figure out which sections are easier or harder\n\nSome sections of the score will just take you more time or mental power than others. They may be longer, more musically difficult, or just generally frustrating. Similarly, other sections will take nothing to learn. I like to organize my learning by alternating these kinds of sections. For example, if I start with a difficult section, the next day I’ll work on an easy section. That way, nothing gets put off until the end, nor do you get learner’s fatigue. It’s just like exercise: you wouldn’t want to put in strenuous exercise several days in a row. Instead, you would mix it up with some lighter activity. \n\n####Put in your language work before your musical work\n\nIf your role is in your native language, congratulations! Your work is easier… for now. If your score is in a foreign language, do your translation and pronunciation work now. Not only will it help you understand how and why the music is written the way it is, you’ll have an understanding of what your character is building towards. I also recommend writing your own translation, first word-for-word and then a poetic one (which I’ll give in more detail for a future post). If you want more help on translating your role, [check out my blog post here](http://www.kristenseikaly.com/why-wordreference-com-is-the-best-translation-tool-for-singers/)\non my favorite FREE translation and pronunciation tool.\n\n####Learn the rhythms and notes\n\nWow, that’s a LOT of work to put in before we even get to the actual music! You’ll thank yourself for it later, since you’ll realize how easy they can come to you now that you’ve already been sitting with the score for a while. Different singers have different opinions on how you should learn the notes. Should you listen to recordings or should you play them out for yourself first? Personally, I say if you need a concept of the style, listen to several recordings once through. That way you don’t get stuck on any one singer’s style, but you have a sense of how the opera runs. Then, learn the rhythms first. Not only will it help line up the words, you’ll already be inclined to add rhythms when you start working notes, so it’ll be helpful if the rhythm is already right. As you learn both notes and rhythms, be sure to isolate parts that give you difficulty rather than barrel through them. It will solve the problem more efficiently. It also helps to look for musical themes. If anything repeats or comes back in a variation, this will speed up your learning process.\n\n####Work with a coach\n\nOnce you feel strong about your notes, go back to those recordings and listen more thoroughly, perhaps even sing along. Be sure to also meet with a coach, preferably one who knows the role or opera well. Now the name of the game is to be ready with the accompaniment, and to have someone spot check anything you may have missed or learned incorrectly. \n\n##3. Become the character\n\nYour music is now learned. Your musical director is very happy with you, and you’re all ready for the sitzprobe (the orchestral rehearsal) before you’ve staged a single thing. You’re not done yet though! While composers do an excellent job of creating musical characters, they can only take you so far. Now is the time to dive into your character’s story and make this role your own.\n\n####Gather as much information as possible\n\nFind any historical, literary, or first-hand information possible about your character. Go back to your translation, and figure out not only what kinds of things your character says, but what other characters say about you. Learn about the time period your character lived in. If you can, read any books or poetry your character may be based on. The beginning stages of my Prince Orlofsky Pinterest board.\n\n####Fill in the gaps\n\nIf there are any gaps in your character’s life, fill them in for yourself. Write out your character’s life story, act like your character at home, or create a Pinterest board filled with images you associate with your character (again, spoilers on my future posts!). The idea is to create a rich backstory.\n\n####Create a quirk\n\nRemember, your character is a living, breathing person. We have all sorts of natural quirks, twitches, and nuances to how we talk, move, even breathe. Think about what quirks your character might have. For example, when I played Cherubino, I found him to be rather twitchy and nervous, especially around the Countess. Therefore, I often scratched or rubbed my neck in shy nervousness. \n\n####Meet with an acting coach or your director\n\nYou may have a thousand amazing ideas about your character, but knowledgeable, focused feedback is always helpful. Find out if your director has any particular ideas about your character. This kind of feedback will also help you discover if what you are attempting to portray is actually coming across. If you feel I have missed something important or would like clarification on anything, please comment below or contact me. If you would like any one-on-one help with a role you’re learning, please feel free to [contact me](http://www.kristenseikaly.com/contact/) and I’d either be happy to coach you myself or direct you to someone who can help you out.\n\n[Kristen Seikaly](http://www.kristenseikaly.com/) is a singer, teacher, and blogger.

        "body": "Yesterday I received an email from DeeAnn Sagar, Youth Leader at [Lawrence Park Community Church](http://www.lawrenceparkchurch.ca/). Last week, the LPCC was unfairly entangled in the controversy surrounding pianist [Valentina Lisitsa](http://www.schmopera.com/valentina-lisitsa-freedom-of-speech-is-a-two-way-street/), whose concerts with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra were cancelled. After the TSO cancelled her concerts, Lisitsa announced the LPCC as the new venue for her Toronto performance, on Friday, April 10th, even though the church hadn't been booked.\n\nSo, I was thrilled to hear from Sagar, who contacted me in the hopes of shedding more public light on what really happenened between Lisitsa and the Lawrence Park Community Church. She put me in touch with the church's Minister, [Dr. John Suk](http://www.lawrenceparkchurch.ca/meet-the-staff.php), who caught the brunt end of the backlash of Lisitsa's unwarranted announcement.\n\nI asked first about the origin of the concert announcement at the LPCC. Dr. Suk explains, \"Someone (I believe it was the gentleman whose pianos are being used by the North York Music Festival) asked the Festival people, on Thursday afternoon, whether or not the festival/church (not sure how it was couched) would be willing to host a Lisitsa concert.\"\n\nThe North York Music Festival left a message for the LPCC on Thursday, April 9th, asking to discuss the matter further; the message had been left after administrative hours, and the church only received it on Friday the 10th. \"No request was made for a booking,\" adds Suk.\n\nWhen Suk realized on Thursday night the story was already circulating in the media, he rushed to speak for the LPCC.\n\n**Suk**: \"I immediately called Canada Press, The Star, and tried to get through to other news venues with this message: We did not rent the facility to Lisitsa. We did not discuss it. This is a huge shock.\"\n\nUpon checking Lisitsa's Twitter feed, Suk read her [announcement](https://twitter.com/DrJohnSuk/status/586371525219069952) of the April 10th concert at his church.\n\n**Suk**: \"I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/DrJohnSuk/status/586371525219069952) her and told her that no booking had been made. I was polite but firm.\"\n\nLisitsa [responded](https://twitter.com/ValLisitsa/status/586315722650951681/photo/1) to Suk, asking, \"But hasn't the festival discuss it with you? or did you receive threats after the announcement?\" Suk responded that there had been no threats (\"Threats? No! None.\"), and that the concert simply had not been booked. \n\nHe adds that the North York Music Festival \"had not promised Lisitsa or the Piano guy that they could do the concert under their banner.\"\n\nSuk was soon flooded with comments on Twitter, condemning his \"[cancellation](https://twitter.com/lepaTnavI/status/586589685780189184/photo/1)\" of Lisitsa's performance. \"Many were filthy, called me a liar, called me by famous war-criminal names,\" he says.\n\nComplicating the story further was the misinformation initially distributed by several media outlets, suggesting the church refused to host Lisitsa. The story was corrected by Canada Press, and  both the [Toronto Star](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/04/09/valentina-lisitsa-to-play-at-north-york-music-festival.html) and [Toronto Sun](http://www.torontosun.com/2015/04/10/controversial-pianist-never-cleared-to-play-toronto-church-minister-says) ran follow-ups.\n\nLisitsa hasn't continued her conversation with the church, and Suk looks to her and the \"Piano guy\" to correct the errors surrounding the situation. He says they're \"not doing the polite thing and letting everyone know that they had made a mistake, and had not followed through on their intention to rent the church. So simple. But no apologies or regrets from either party.\"\n\nThe church would have been willing to discuss the possibility of a concert, says Suk, \"if we had received a request.\"\n\n**Suk**: \"Lisitsa has a right to free speech, and she makes use of that. But in the meantime she has become a controversial figure that polarizes Toronto. For us to have a discussion about such a rental before it happens would only be natural.\"\n\nI'm in complete agreement with Dr. Suk. I'm surprised at Lisitsa's silence on this issue. The Lawrence Park Community Church spent last weekend fending off vitriolic emails, and scrambling to keep their website and social media pages free from uninformed insults. I see a similarity with [Stewart Goodyear](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=896368443719370&id=184834198206135), who was initially asked to replace Lisitsa with the TSO, but he was pushed to withdraw after facing hateful backlash from Lisitsa's supporters. If Lisitsa herself were to speak explicitly about her miscommunication with the LPCC, or about the rights of free speech extending to a fellow pianist like Goodyear, it would certainly help quell the Internet mob.",

        "body": "I went yesterday afternoon to see [*The Barber of Seville*](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BarberofSeville.aspx) at the Four Seasons Centre. The anticipation was serious, especially since I was able to see the director's concept discussion, and I interviewed three singers from the cast ([Joshua Hopkins](/talking-figaro-with-joshua-hopkins/), [Alek Shrader](/talking-with-counts-alek-shrader/), and [Serena Malfi](/serena-malfi-on-singing-rosina/)). So, I was fairly hyped up for this production, and full of curiosity.\n\nDirector Joan Font creates an exaggerated world of characters, which I think works beautifully with the cartoon-like pacing in Rossini's score. Font started with the *Commedia dell'arte*, connecting Figaro with Harlequin, Rosina with Colombina, and Dottor Bartolo with Pantalone. Font writes, \"they are prototypes of humanity played in a symbolic manner and able to create absurd, delirious, surreal, comical and ironic situations and actions.\"\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429540782546/Barber-MC-0370.jpg)\n<figcaption>\nl-r: Alek Shrader (Almaviva) and Joshua Hopkins (Figaro). Photo by Michael Cooper. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nTenor [Alek Shrader](https://twitter.com/alekshrader) kicked off this surreal world with an impressive \"Ecco ridente.\" Shrader mentioned to me that this was his 11th run as Count Almaviva, and I thought it showed in a great way. Alek spent the entire role prioritizing the story and humour over everything else. He took huge risks in \"Ecco,\" moving in and out of his full, balanced tenor sound, and using moments of *sotto voce* and extra-flowery *fioratura*. There was no doubt that we were allowed to laugh at the Count's overdone serenade to Rosina, and I loved that Shrader hammed it up. He showed us that he was a serious singer more than once during the show, and I loved that he had nothing to prove; I found myself sympathizing with Almaviva more than I usually do in *Barber*. Also, Alek's air piano was some of the best I've ever seen. See, this is the fun part of hearing a singer in a role they know so well.\n\nAs Figaro, Canadian baritone [Joshua Hopkins](http://joshuahopkins.com/) was, well, perfect. He didn't break a sweat in \"Largo al factotum,\" and he found ease in the rest of the demanding role. He too put storytelling in front of everything else, yet he never lacked for a gorgeous sound. For me, Joshua found the best connection between his voice and body. The production's large gestures fell often on Figaro, and he found musical moments for all the right movements. The proof was in the audience's laughter. Together, Joshua and Alek had fantastic comic chemistry, and their Act I duet had me grinning from ear to ear.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429540929977/Barber-MC-1230.jpg)\n<figcaption>\nl-r: Joshua Hopkins (Figaro), Alek Shrader (Almaviva), Serena Malfi (Rosina), Robert Gleadow (Basilio), Aviva Fortunata (Berta), Renato Girolami (Bartolo). Photo by Michael Cooper </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n[Serena Malfi](http://www.serenamalfi.com/) sang with a really rich, beautiful mezzo sound, and showed off her impressive high register. I didn't get the sense of fun in her Rosina, though. Her coloratura was clean and clear, but it didn't quite sound free, or have that feeling of improvisation. She had more fun in the second act, yet I still found her subdued, perhaps in comparison to some of her castmates.\n\n[Renato Girolami](http://www.renatogirolami.com/mobile/index.php) as Dr. Bartolo was a study in buffo characters. He was a blustering tryant with anger issues, who seemed like he may actually give Figaro and Almaviva a run for their money. Girolami is a veteran with Rossini buffo roles, and it completely showed. I loved him.\n\nRobert Gleadow was similar as Basilio; he's a tall guy, but the prosthetic nose, semi-bald cap, and exaggerated movements made his chracterization super-sized, so it could be super-funny. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429542314601/Barber-MC-0473.jpg)\n<figcaption>\nl-r: Renato Girolami (Bartolo) and Robert Gleadow (Basilio). Photo by Michael Cooper.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAs Berta, Rosina's governess, Aviva Fortunata was hilarious. She had all that \"listening action\" that can be so full of comic moments; I want to see it again, and sit a bit closer, because I have a feeling Aviva had some priceless facial expressions. I was glad they kept Berta's aria for her, too. \n\nCOC Ensemble members Iain MacNeil (Fiorello) and Clarence Frazer (Officer) showed off solid singing and great comic stage presence. I'm really excited to see them in their roles for the Ensemble Studio Performance of *Barber* on May 15th. Frazer will take the role of Figaro, and MacNeil will become Dr. Bartolo. For full details and tickets to the show, [click here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BarberofSeville/EnsembleStudioPerformance.aspx). \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1429543509861/Barber-MC-1483.jpg)\n<figcaption> Alek Shrader (Almaviva/Basilio), and Serena Malfi (Rosina). Photo by Michael Cooper. </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe orchestra sounded shiny and spectacular in that really famous overture, under the baton of Rory Macdonald. I thought a few of his tempi were a little heavy, and there were moments where I thought he could have gone more with the singers. I wondered how much license he gave to the cast in terms of ornamentation and cadenzas. A few numbers felt like the ended a little flat, and I wondered if we could have done with a couple more cheesy high notes on fermatas.\n\nThe production was endlessly interesting to watch. Eleven actors shared the stage with the cast and chorus, physicalizing important moments in the story. They had great mini-scenes during Basilio's \"La calunnia\" and Berta's \"Il vecchiotto cerca moglie.\" Figaro had five actor doppelgängers during \"Largo al factotum,\" demonstrating Figaro's true Renaissance-manness. I thought they were brilliant, moving so uniquely and specifically that they had developed their own silent characters. Many of the actors were hanging around Bartolo's place; I figure they're some of his longer-term patients. The old woman seated downstage for large portions of the opera had her own secret stories going on, and they kept me curious and laughing.\n\nThere were a few stilted moments in the show, as if the elements onstage weren't organically connected to each other. Despite the exaggerated production, some of the comic moments weren't quite big enough. Some of these moments I think could have been solved by having less good taste in the orchestra pit (over-the-top music to go with the over-the-top everything else). I'll see it again on May 15th, for the Ensemble Studio performance, and I'm curious to see how the show settles between now and then, and what happens with a brand new cast.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend *The Barber of Seville*. Totally entertaining, great singing, and that's sort of all you need. For more information about this production, check out the box office link below.\n",

So, director Bruce Gowers was right on the money when he decided to make it all about Queen, doing what they do best. We go back and forth between catching a close-up of Freddie Mercury sing a live show, to those eerie, surreal shots of the four of them. \n\nBest of all, every shift in focus happens at a musical event; when a solo voice goes to a chorus, or at that great \"will not let you go (let you go!)\" bit into the guitar solo. Everything comes from the song, and the stuff of the music is put in the forefront.\n\nAnother great example is the video from Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Same deal, 90s-style.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hTWKbfoikeg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n###Weird for the sake of weird\n\nLet's face it, sometimes you can catch a super weird [*L'elisir d'amore*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2sMbPbq-EM) or a baffling [*Lohengrin*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jelAXy5d7XE). I'm not equating Hans Neuenfels' work with the Talking Heads, but it's definitely weird, perhaps for the sake of it. The Talking Heads do weird, à-la-80s. \n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1wg1DNHbNU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n###So mesmerizing, you don't care what's going on\n\nWhen I saw Daniele Finzi Pasca's production of [*L'amour de loin*](https://definitelytheopera.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/saariaho-at-coc/) at the COC, I felt this way. The music and text of the opera were unfolding, but in a way that allowed for abstract, visually arresting scenes onstage. I feel the same way about Christopher Walken in this Fatboy Slim video by Spike Jonze:\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZM1fkHQP_Pw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n###The additional story that still works\n\nSometimes an opera is old enough, or non-specific enough that a director finds a [new story to tell](/in-review-tcherniakovs-don-giovanni/). It's not quite superimposition of a story, because it comes from details in the text, but it's still a surprise, making the listeners think, \"I didn't know that's what it was about.\" Kind of like the video for Coldplay's \"The Scientist.\" Remember this one?\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RB-RcX5DS5A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\n###Going with the flow\n\nThe best opera productions are the ones that go with the flow. That means that if the music is fun, they make fun happen onstage. If a singer kills it with her aria every time, a good director will let her have downstage centre and get out of her way. Kind of like [Robert Carsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P85S_70oSOk), and exactly like Jake Nava did with Beyoncé in this classic.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4m1EFMoRFvY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nOr if the music has something weird about it, like Prokofiev or Britten always do, the director lets it happen onstage, too. I always loved this Missy Elliott video for \"Work It.\" It's got the stuff of classic hip-hop videos, but everything is just a little bit wonky.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zm28EEeyLek\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nWhat did I miss?

They start with inspiration from the song (or score), they allow for the artist to bring his or her personality to the mix, and the end result should be greater than the sum of its parts (the parts being what we hear and what we see).\n\nBear with me, readers, as I show you a few more examples of the common roots in opera and music video direction.",

        "body": "Singers, I know you've heard this before, but seriously, you all need to get websites. Some of you don't have websites, *or* Twitter accounts, *or* Facebook pages. I'd name names, but you're not on the Internet.\n\nWhy is it so important? Basically, so that you're not a name without context. Any time I write a review, I try to add an external link for every name I mention. Now, the point of a singer's website isn't necessarily to rack up high volumes of traffic, but it's nice for readers who see your name in a review or promotional piece, to be able to find out more. They want to see what you look like when you're not in costume, and they want to see what else you're about.\n\nIf a singer has a manager, he or she probably has an artist page on their management's website. This usually has all the important information, but it doesn't really say anything about who you are. That might sound like icing rather than a necessity, but you guys are performers, and you're not just presenting the sound of your voice. Your *own* online presence will be what satisfies a curious Googler.\n\nSo, what does your website need?\n\n###Simplicity\n\nThis is one of the most important parts. Things like a \"welcome\" screen*****, random animations, or even a too-busy homepage can obscure the information that you want out there. Your home page really only needs a photo, and any social media or external links. Visually, less is more. [Erin Wall](http://www.erinwall.com/) is a Canadian soprano, and I absolutely *love* [her website](http://www.erinwall.com/). It's stunning to look at, and easy to navigate.\n\nLess is more when it comes to the entry point of your website. Live Twitter feeds, videos here, your blog, an Instagram feed - they're all good ideas, just not all on the same screen. Clutter doesn't get people to explore your site, but simplicity will pique their interest.\n\n*****One exception to the No-Welcome-Screen rule is if your website is bilingual. Multi-lingual websites can still be easy to peruse; [Anna Netrebko's site](http://www.annanetrebko.com/) is in three languages, with no extra steps.\n\n###Headshot\n\nPhotos are important for public and media-related visitors to your site. Lots of singers have photo galleries available, but I often find that I can't do anything with the photos except admire them. This is totally fine, but you should have a couple of preferred shots available to download, at a minimum size of 1024x728. Size does matter in this case; it's the difference between a beautifully crisp shot of you, and a pixellated mess. Also, be sure to clearly credit your photographer.\n\n###Biography\n\nAlso vital is an updated biography. Résumés are good for auditions and applications, but for media, the bio is where it's at. You should have a long and short bio available for download, right next to your headshots. Personally, when I use a biography, I don't want to misrepresent the singer, so I put my trust in what he or she has available online. When I search for a singer's bio, and that singer doesn't have a website or management page, often I get results from promotional pages from their past gigs. These bios may have been altered to fit a specific company, and I'm hesitant to use them (they also may be private property). It should be very easy to find your biography from a \"primary source,\" like your website or management page.\n\nKeep in mind that most media workers will use your biography as is, so make sure you're satisfied with what's there. Depending on how frequently you're working, be sure to keep your bio updated; at the very least, make sure you don't have past gigs listed as \"upcoming events.\"\n\n###Audio & Video\n\nFor me, I don't find these as necessary as a headshot or bio, but they're a good idea if you're a singer. Your recordings can be simple links to your Soundcloud account or YouTube channel, or you can embed the media right into your website (keeping in mind the value of simplicity).\n\nOne thing I really don't recommend is having audio or video that plays automatically when someone visits your site. It's more annoying than inviting, so leave the listening opportunities to the discretion of your audience.\n\n###Social Media Links\n\nTwitter and Facebook allow for people to keep track of you in real-time. Links to your Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc., should be clearly visible on the homepage of your website, and the links should open these pages in a new tab (so your viewers don't have to leave your website to see your Instagram account). I write more about using social media to your advantage in [part 1](/singers-heres-how-to-use-social-media/).\n\n>Keep your eyes out for a follow-up post on this topic, with detailed advice from a web developer's point of view. If you're leaving your website to a pro, you'll know just what to ask for. In the meantime, leave any questions you have in the comment section.",

        "body": "You might have read the recent [interview](http://www.courier-journal.com/story/entertainment/arts/music/2015/04/20/challenges-black-opera-singers/26096103/) in *The Courrier-Journal* with Eric Owens and Morris Robinson, who sing King Philip II and the Grand Inquisitor in Opera Philadelphia's upcoming [*Don Carlo*](https://www.operaphila.org/whats-on/on-stage-2014-2015/don-carlo/). Mike Silverman asks them about the \"challenges of being a black opera singer.\"\n\nTimes are admittedly changing within the opera world, and it's not difficult to find successful black opera singers, at least in North America. When asked about their being role models for aspiring black singers, Robinson responded, \"I think we give hope to a lot of cats who are in school studying, who look like us and pursue this career and don't see very many examples.\"\n\nI think it's fair to say that with all the white Aidas who have ever graced the opera stage, it's not a relevant conversation to discuss the \"accuracy\" of having a black singer portray a character like King Philip II. I think having a cast of singers that mirrors our diverse population is one of the ways that opera will maintain its spot among the living arts.\n\nIt struck me, though, that while barriers like race have dissipated quickly, an opera career can still be contingent on a few factors, many of which fall under \"luck of the draw.\"\n\nTake Robinson's answer about being role models; he's completely right, but there's a catch. Those aspiring singers have to see him and Eric Owens in action in order to be inspired.\n\nExposing people to opera has everything to do with getting them when they're young. I've done several school tours with the Canadian Opera Company, and we visit over 30 schools to present what's often the first opera these kids have seen. I love how young audiences react to live music and theatre, but their singular experience with opera isn't enough for kids to form a connection with the art form.\n\nAfter each show on our school tours, we answer questions from the kids in the audiences. A common question is some variance of, \"How can I do what you guys do?\" We answer truthfully, but incompletely. We tell them that learning to sing or play the piano is like training for a marathon; small distances eventually lead to long distances, and you slowly push the limits of your body.\n\nAll this is true, but I doubt I'm the only one among my colleagues who knows that mastering vocal technique is only applicable if a few other important steps are in place, too.\n\nI wasn't one of those kids who saw That One Concert, the one that instantly solidified in me a love of music. That love was slowly fostered over almost two decades, by going to hear show after show and being involved in everything from choirs to piano lessons to clarinet quartets. My parents were models of perseverance; they continued taking me to my lessons without hesitation, often simply because I didn't ask them to stop. My mother was smart. She figured, since I wasn't complaining, that I may as well take auxiliary courses like theory and history, along with my piano and clarinet lessons.\n\nSo, take the child living in a low-income family, in a place far away from major cultural centres. What if his parents don't have a connection to music or theatre? What if they have no way of seeing the benefit of music lessons in their child's development? What if they do, but can't afford to buy them an instrument, let alone send them for lessons? What if there aren't any music teachers where they live?\n\nIf at school one day that child sees an opera, or something similar, what can come of his excitement?\n\nI say all this to make the point that inspiration is a vital, yet small piece of the puzzle. At the early stages of music development, quantity of exposure and opportunities is where it's at. There are a few hurdles along the path to an operatic career, and one of them used to be race. The money hurdle is still there, constantly in the way.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, The Metropolitan Opera was a place where black opera singers had the chance to show that they were not only onstage, but they deserved to be up there in the spotlight. It was a step that led to Eric Owens and Morris Robinson sharing a stage in *Don Carlo*. What can be done about the problem of income and class? I won't look first to the Met to start that ball rolling...\n\nKids recognize this in the athletes they idolize; they're familiar with the system of training (and money) that goes into being a runner or tennis player. I suppose the difference between athletes and opera singers is that kids have probably seen less of the latter.\n\nI think it's another argument for nomadic opera companies, for touring shows and pared down productions in venues that don't come with associations of the ultra-wealthy. Quantity, like I said, is the best approach for young people, and not only because they'll hear more music. They'll see more performers, too. They'll see them as a population of people, like an slice of society, and perhaps more kids will recognize that these singers and players are not superhuman.\n\nWhen it comes to showing young music-lovers that their passion can become their paycheque, I think it's important to prove that the role models they meet are not exceptions to the rule. \n\n",

        "body": "Singers, how much do you love auditions? I know you're all troopers, experts at the art of wowing someone in two arias or less. It's really all about making your way through the huge list of Things You Can't Control. Often, one of those things is the prowess of your audition pianist.\n\nI've played a few auditions myself, and I've heard from my singer friends many glorious stories of pianist-related adventures. Singers often haven't met their audition pianist ahead of time, so they may only have a few moments to tell them what they'll start with, how their cadenza goes, what tempo they like, etc., if that. Singing with a new pianist can be a fair factor in how an audition goes, but the goal is to sing your arias the way you sing them best, and let the pianist take care of him or herself. Here are a few tips for singers to show a new pianist exactly what you need in your (yes, *your*) audition.\n\n###Breathe in your tempo\n\nMost good singers do this without giving it much thought. It's worth paying some attention to how you breathe during your arias, because it can the first line of communication between you and a new pianist. A good pianist will pay attention to the breath you take before your first phrase, and adjust their tempo accordingly. Think of arias like \"Casta diva,\" which starts with a long, sustained note from the singer; that long note can feel like a punishment if the pianist is playing slower than you can comfortably sing the phrase. Or that corner in the Count's aria from *Le nozze di Figaro* (\"Ah no! lasciarti in pace...\"); the baritone has to set a new tempo for the pianist, and it's super easy to do with an indicative breath. I personally prefer when he breathes a half-bar's worth in the new tempo.\n\n###Lead with language\n\nLeading with language really just means using a single word to dictate a tempo. This is simpler to do in languages that have more consonants; German and English are easy-peasy, and French and Italian are a little less indicative (although at least Italian can have some great double consonants). A German word like \"Freude\" has three opportunities to inform a new pianist: a fast or slow letter **F**, the pace of the rolled **R**, and the proportion of vowel time in that \"eu\" diphthong. \n\nA good pianist will wait until they hear a rolled **R** before they even think about putting that chord down for \"Freude,\" and so if you spend time on the **F**, it's like giving an extra heads-up about tempo. While you're singing the vowels in \"Freude,\" a pianist is listening to when you go from [ɔ] to [i] or [e], to get a sense of how long the word really is.\n\nConversely, if a pianist hears a singer who makes quick work of consonant clusters and diphthongs, it's a clear indication that the tempo should be quicker, probably more speech-like.\n\n###Don't be afraid to be \"not together\"\n\nThis is really a conversation about being brave. If your aria starts with a piano introduction, and it's too fast or too slow, you can either a) breathe and hope you make it, or b) change the tempo. I vote for option B. The only way you can change a tempo set by your pianist is, well, by singing at a different tempo. Sure, you might have a bar or two (hopefully less) of not-so-great ensemble, but it's absolutely preferable to singing your aria at someone else's pacing (especially since you put all that work into it).\n\nAnother bonus is that the auditioners will notice that you're taking charge of your music. They can tell the difference between ensemble problems, and a singer leading a pianist. Even if the pianist doesn't follow you at all, the auditioners will see that you know your stuff cold.\n\n###You do you\n\nIn short, singers, auditions are where you show yourself and your work. This means that it's more than enough to simply sing the way you know you can, under *your* circumstances. I've never met a pianist who is unwilling to help you give a great audition, but in an audition, it's ultimately up to you to recreate the environment in which you *want* to sing. \n\nIt's a hugely valuable thing to demonstrate that you are a singer who can do their job without getting rattled by surprises or unknowns. Directors and conductors want to know this about you, and it doesn't show that you're stubborn or inflexible to work with. Instead, it shows that you know what you want to say with your arias, and you're making that the first priority. \n\nAnd hey, if your pianist manages to make some music with you as you do that, consider hiring them again.",

        "body": "###Do singers really need to use social media?\n\nYep. You do.\n\nNow, I suppose the technical answer is no, you don't *need* to, you can all make your own decisions. And of course, whether or not you use social media doesn't change your singing technique or your stage presence. It *does* change how visible you are, and it would be a shame for your hard work to fall on deaf ears. If you have a website, that's a great start, but most people aren't likely to check the websites of their preferred singers regularly. They *do* go on Facebook and Twitter all the damn time, and so that's where singers can tell the world about their great new gig or their cool costume.\n\nIt may sound superfluous or unnecessary, but people are naturally curious, and your job is super interesting. Give them a little taste.\n\n###Get organized, get connected\n\nBe diligent about linking up all your social media accounts. Your Twitter bio should include links to your Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc., and vice versa. On your website, they should be easy to find, and all in one place. You’ll have crossover with the content on various social media platforms (photos on Instagram and Twitter, videos on YouTube and Facebook, for examples), and the more you connect your accounts, the easier it will be for your followers to notice. \n\n###Post when you're not at work, and post about others\n\nThe biggest trap into which singers can fall is using their Facebook and Twitter accounts strictly for self-promotion. You're absolutely allowed to talk about your work online, but if your feed resembles an ad-campaign, your followers may stop paying attention to what you post.\n\nWhen you're not posting about your awesome make-up job, or putting up backstage photos from your latest gig, your social media presence shouldn't wane. It doesn't mean you need to shallowly publish photos of your cat or your latte, though. A better way to bridge the online gap between show nights is to reach out to others.\n\nFind out details about that upcoming competition your colleague is in, and tell your own followers all about it. Check out what's going on with companies or festivals with whom you've worked (or would like to work), and give them an online shoutout. Retweet, reshare, reblog.\n\nWhen the time comes again for you to shamelessly promote your work, which *is still a good thing*, you'll have already invested in the reciprocity that is so vital to social media. In short, scratch their backs, and they'll scratch yours.\n\n###Show us that you're more than a singer\n\nI know a few of you singers are also avid soccer players, yogis, foodies, film buffs, salsa dancers, photographers, ju-jitsu fighters, and parents. That stuff is cool! And relevant! Honestly, nothing makes people more impressed with your singing than the knowledge that you *also* bake bread from scratch and have two kids. Those things make you a superhero, and they make you a whole person. Not everyone can identify with #singerlife, but we all know what it's like to multi-task.\n\n###Acknowledge that you have fans, and that those fans are people\n\nBecause you're not constantly posting about your own singing, you've fostered a group of followers with varying points of entry into the world of opera. So, when you do have a show, and some of these followers (fans, really) are in the audience, it's the absolute perfect time to make a individual connections over Twitter. Did your pre-show selfie get a bunch of retweets? Are people wishing you luck from their seats? Let them know you're paying attention, by reponding or sharing as soon as possible. \n\nThe intermission tweet is an especially valuable tool. Your followers in the audience now know that you're just like them, checking their phone when you're on break, and chiming in on the well-wishes and feedback from the show in real time. So, whenever you can spare some attention, take a few moments to consider your fans and make them love you even more.\n\n###Think outside the box\n\nStanding out in the ocean of social media profiles takes creativity; that's *great news*, because you're all artists. When I say \"think outside the box,\" I'm talking about the connections you make with your work in opera, and the rest of the world. \n\nSimple options are a shout-out to the restaurant where you have your post-show dinner (maybe you went for French food post-*La bohème*?), or to the designer of the dress or tux you wore onstage, for making you look so fab.\n\nAre you getting ready to sing Figaro in *Il barbiere di Siviglia*? Tweet at a social-media-friendly barbershop in your area, and ask for their best tips on shaving with a straight-razor.\n\nWorking on *L'elisir d'amore*? That next bottle of wine you buy from your local winery, should probably be a #Bordeaux.\n\nDoes your costume have a bustle? Tweet some jokes to your local gym or personal trainer about how you've gotta lose some of that booty. Also, [#twerking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZJ0F5pt0sY).\n\n###Good examples\n\nHere are a few singers whose social media habits I really like. Bonus: they happen to be all ladies. (Well done, ladies!) \n\n* Joyce DiDonato: [@JoyceDiDonato](https://twitter.com/JoyceDiDonato)\n* Simone Osborne: [@Simone Osborne](https://twitter.com/SimoneOsborne)\n* Tamara Wilson: [@tamschloo](https://twitter.com/tamschloo), [Exit Stage Left](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6jidviYzIjuBRq_5mzIgzQ)\n* Christine Goerke: [@HeldenMommy](https://twitter.com/HeldenMommy)\n* Elizabeth DeShong: [@egdeshong](https://twitter.com/egdeshong), [A Singer's Suitcase](http://www.asingerssuitcase.com/)\n\nWho do you like to follow?

        "body": "Yesterday I went to hear [Metro Youth Opera](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/)'s production of Berlioz' *Béatrice & Bénédict* at Daniels Spectrum. I hadn't seen the opera before, and whenever I plan to see a piece for the first time, I rarely look up details like a plot synopsis. I'm one of those people that thinks that opera fans should have the option of enjoying a piece without needing to do homework, and I was pleased that MYO's *B&B* was clear and entertaining, language barriers (and Shakespeare) aside.\n\n*B&B* is one of those pieces that sets a bizarre, almost exasperating story, to some objectively gorgeous music. There are more than a few beautiful arias, and the ladies have duets and trios that distracted me, in a good way, from the absurd scene going on under the music. Director Alison Wong embraced the story's absurdities, letting the audience know we were allowed to laugh. With minimal sets and indicative costumes (the bride-to-be, whether she knows it or not, is always in some shade of white), the focus was pulled right onto the characters.\n\nMetro Youth Opera \"exists to create viable development opportunities for young artists in all fields related to the world of opera: singers, stage directors, music directors, and more.\" The cast of young singers was strong, and they had great specificity in their web of relationships. As Béatrice, [Simone McIntosh](https://twitter.com/Smcintosh91) had strength in her voice and body that easily set her apart from the other ladies. Béatrice isn't a light role, and Simone did an admirable job of managing light coloratura with long, lyric phrases that stretched way up and way down. I heard a few moments in Béatrice's Act II aria that reminded me of Berlioz's *Nuits d'été*, which isn't a bad thing at all. What really stuck out for me was how Simone showed us a Béatrice who was acting tough, but whose insecurities are totally transparent for the audience.\n\nAs her (eventual) lover, Bénédict, tenor [Asitha Tennekoon](https://twitter.com/asithatennekoon) really impressed me. His is another taxing role, with some corners that seemed pretty nasty on Berlioz's end. Asitha kept his body and voice relaxed, despite the abundance of anger-motivated arias and duets. If you live in the 21st century, it's hard to make a character like Bénédict likeable, but Asitha succeeded.\n\n[Lindsay McIntyre](https://twitter.com/lindsaymariamc) had what sounded like some of the most difficult music of the night, in her role as Béatrice's friend, Héro. She was a great foil to the awkward, combative Béatrice; Lindsay smiled sweetly all the time, even when she was basically just meddling in her friend's life in Act II. Héro has beautiful, endless lines in her aria, which Lindsay sang smart, with just enough voice. \n\nAs Ursule, [Alessia Naccarato](https://twitter.com/alinaccs) had a warm and light mezzo sound that blended beautifully with Lindsay in their *stunning* duet. There was something subtle and intriguing about Alessia, and I'd really like to hear her in more stuff, soon.\n\nThe men were great bros, with lots of slapstick comedy and corny dialogue. [Janaka Welihinda](https://twitter.com/JanakaGW) as Claudio and Peter Warren as Don Pedro both sang with booming, wide sounds that worked well with their exaggerated physical presences. \n\nMusic director [Natasha Fransblow](https://twitter.com/tashfrans) played the whole score at her personal Steinway orchestra, and it made me curious to hear the orchestration. Natasha gave solid support and flexibility to the cast. I only wish that the space had been a bit more acoustically fogiving. The fabric curtains and all the bodies in the audience soaked up much of the sound, and I think it took away slightly from the depth and variation of sound we could have gotten from the piano. \n\nLike I said before, the piece is a bit exasperating. Boy and girl are secretly in love, but their pride and insecurities limit their interactions to the antagonistic kind. Both Béatrice and Bénédict have laughably fast turnarounds from hate to love, and only when they overhear that the other is in love with them. Their respective friends orchestrate their getting together in a very sitcom-like way (\"HEY, DID YOU HEAR BEATRICE IS IN LOVE WITH BENEDICT?\", et cetera). I couldn't help but think that two people with such deep-rooted misconceptions and insecurities about marriage and relationships really should first work on themselves. But hey, that's not comedy.\n\nSo, I thought the piece was entertaining and well-sung by this cast of young singers, and I look forward to hearing all of them a bit more in the coming seasons. If you can make it, the last performance of [*Béatrice & Bénédict*](http://www.metroyouthopera.ca/201415-season/) happens today at 2:30pm at Daniels Spectrum, 585 Dundas St. E.",

        "body": "###1. Can you tell us any details about what audiences will hear from BOP this summer?\n\n\nYes! We’re so excited to share our 2015 production, *shadow box*, with audiences this season. Eight Canadian contemporary opera scenes make up the show, but they will be told with single narrative through-line. *shadow box* explores the mind’s relationship to memory: what we treasure dearly and what haunts us in turn. Working with returning stage director Liza Balkan and set designer and projectionist Sonja Rainey, we’ll be creating our first visually unified show that uses live projection art to enhance the storytelling. \n\n*shadow box* is: *The Yellow Wallpaper* by Cecilia Livingston and Nicolas Billon, *The Auction – Prologue* by John Burge and Eugene Benson, *What time is it now?* by Anna Höstman and P.K. Page, *The Blind Woman* by James Rolfe and David Yee, *Dreaming Duet* (from *The Bells of Baddeck*) by Dean Burry and Lorna MacDonald, *Our Lady of Esquimalt Road* by Leila Lustig and Geoff Hargreaves, and *Submission*  by Dean Burry and David Yee. \n\nBack by popular demand, our program would not be complete without *Bianchi: A five-minute Bicycle Opera*, basically a five-minute long bike pun. \n\nAnd finally, we are pleased to be premiering a brand new Bicycle Opera commission: *Ride of the Bicycle Bells*, a miniature piece by Chris Thornborrow for 11 bicycle bells and one bike horn!\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430155855338/14515384548_8696c9b9dd_o.jpg)\n<figcaption>Photo by Gary Lloyd-Rees</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n###2. What can you tell us about *The Bells of Baddeck*?\n\n*The Bells of Baddeck* is a new music drama created by Lorna MacDonald and music by Dean Burry about Alexander Graham and Mabel Bell. Alexander and Mabel were true movers and shakers whose legacy extends far beyond the telephone. \n\nWe’re really thrilled that all four BOP cast members, plus cellist Erika Nielsen, will be engaged as artists in residence for seven weeks in Cape Breton this summer. Bicycle Opera’s baritone, Geoffrey Sirett will be playing Alexander Graham Bell, I play his daughter, Daisy, mezzo Stephanie Tritchew plays his mother, and tenor Chris Enns plays their dear friend, pilot Tom Selfridge. \n\nI’m probably most excited about living together in a big house by the sea for seven weeks!\n\nBicycle Opera is taking advantage of our residence in Baddeck to embark on our own East Coast tour of shadow box. Once *The Bells of Baddeck* closes on August 2nd, we’ll be testing our legs on the Nova Scotia terrain for a mini 9-day tour with concert dates along the way.\n\n###3. How do you guys manage to bring everything you need for a tour, just with bicycles?\n\nWe create minimalist sets and staging to ensure that we can tour exclusively by bicycle. Typically cast members pack their personal stuff into two panniers/saddle bags that are carried on bike, and two bicycle trailers are used which are packed with props, costumes, and instruments. Sonja is creating a set and costume design that is based on economy, utilizing bicycle gear that we will be bringing along anyway. While we will always stay true to our pared down approach, adding set and projection art elements for shadow box means we will have to expand from a two-trailer show to four! (Well, actually this is still up for debate. Geoff thinks three trailers will be plenty after consulting the Google maps altitude graph for Nova Scotia.)\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1430156000088/14679046396_4a4e557a9e_o.jpg)\n<figcaption>Photo by Gary Lloyd-Rees</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n###4. How much of your travels to the east cost will be strictly on bicycle? Have you calculated your kms yet?\n\nI’d love to cycle all the way to the East Coast, but having done it before, I know that it takes a month...and that’s without putting on opera simultaneously. We’ll be cycling from Baddeck to Halifax, 383 kilometers, while putting on four shows and all in 9 days! From Halifax we’ll be taking the train to Toronto and commencing our tour of Ontario all the way until September 6th. Our exact route is still being finalized, but my current calculation has us beating last year’s record of 1,007 kilometers. \n\n###5. BOP is a supporter of new Canadian opera. What do you think makes an opera \"good\", and what makes it relevant?\n\nI’m passionate about works that have a degree of social relevance. Opera is, at its most basic level, storytelling, and we need our audience to connect to the story. Opera’s fusion of drama and music has the ability to move people intensely and if a composer is able to create music that moves people while telling a well-written story, that’s the stuff. We work to break down some of the barriers to opera and a major way we do that is to produce opera in English. We feel strongly that opera should be done in the vernacular way more often than it is. We are interested in producing works that showcase a variety of contemporary musical styles; we love new music that challenges the listener and we love simply beautiful music. Either way, the music has to be compelling and must be bound to the story.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Last night I went to opening night of *Earnest, the Importance of Being* at [Toronto Operetta Theatre](http://www.torontooperetta.com/shows.html). The piece, by Victor Davies and Eugene Benson, had its premiere in 2008. It's a rare thing to find an original Canadian operetta, and this one is a hilarious and charming take on Oscar Wilde's *The Importance of Being Earnest*.\n\nThe dialoge is taken directly from Wilde, and the sung libretto by Eugene Benson is an organic extension of the original text, full of Wilde-esque plays on words and really dry wit. The music itself takes a lot from the traditional operetta style, with funny pizzicato moments and soaring melodies; conductor Larry Beckwith led the orchestra with flexibility and fun. The moments of musical comedy were a bit surprising at times, like the pentatonic scales and gongs when there's talk of Japan; I got the funny intent, it just seemed a bit dated for a piece less than ten years old. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431190577154/Cecily-%26-Algernon.jpg)\n<figcaption>Thomas Macleay and Charlotte Knight. Photo by Gary Beechey.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis cast is a strong one, featuring baritone [Cameron McPhail](https://twitter.com/Cameron_McPhail) as John Worthing, the dashing bachelor with a mysterious familial past. He sounded clear and rich in the theatre, using some of the show's more lyric lines to his advantage. I thought he made a charming, charismatic \"Earnest,\" and a great foil in voice and mannerisms to his brother Algernon.\n\nTenor [Thomas Macleay](http://www.thomasmacleay.com/Thomas_Macleay/Welcome.html) as Algernon was another idealistic young man in search of a wife, willing to change his name to suit her. He was a fantastic fit in this role, and he looked incredibly at home in the witty, silly, romantic style of the piece. He sang with a throaty, raw sound that was really appealing. He even threw in a few pretty *falsetto* touches.\n\nThe ladies were a hoot. Michelle Garlough was self-important and self-reverential as Gwendolyn Fairfax, set on marrying Earnest (provided his name really is Earnest). She managed to combine ditziness and self-respect into a hilarious woman who sets a high bar for her suitors. It was great to hear her in a more substantial role, and this wasn't an easy one. Some of the trickiest vocal moments were also supposed to be funny, and I thought she nailed it.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431190590936/Gwendolen-%26-Jack-1.jpg)\n<figcaption>Cameron McPhail and Michelle Garlough. Photo by Gary Beechey</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n[Charlotte Knight](http://charlotteknightsoprano.com/) was the younger, more shrill Cecily Cardew, set on marrying \"Earnest,\" or anyone else with a name that begins with \"E\" and ends in \"T.\" She had most of the vocal fireworks in the show, written impossibly high and repetitively. Charlotte did a spectacular job just singing the thing, plus she added all the comic cues to the most ridiculous of her cadenzas. She had whiny, brat-like moments that made me think of Jenna from *30 Rock*. Her duet with Gwendolyn got the biggest applause of the night, and rightly so. \n\n[Jean Stilwell](http://www.jeanstilwell.com/Home.html) was a total force as Lady Bracknell. She sang with a huge, terrifying sound that matched her Maggie-Smith-like \"formidable lady.\" She had some of the best Wilde lines of the night and delivered them deliciously. Applause broke out as she first appeared, and I loved the Wagner-inspired chords announcing each of her entrances. I found it difficult to understand her all the time, but her intent was always clear.\n\nRosalind McArthur and [Gregory Finney](https://twitter.com/gregory_finney) were appropriately hilarious as Miss Prism and Reverend Canon Chasuble. I got every single word from both of them, and they were those great characters that draw your eye despite the primary action happening centre stage. I thought Greg's singing in this role was some of the best I'd heard him do. Bravo, friend!\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431190604217/Lady-Bracknell-1.jpg)\n<figcaption>Jean Stillwell. Photo by Gary Beechey.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe cast gave this piece the energy and specificity it needs. I thought the music tended to work against the singers, specifically in the way the English text is set. Much of time the text didn't suit the line of the music, like the way \"Earnest\" so often fell with an accent on the last syllable. The singers weren't thrown off by it, but I think it would have solved many of the problems of obscured text.\n\nTOT Artistic Director Guillermo Silva-Marin let the story unfold clearly, cleverly making use of mirror staging between the two sets of would-be lovers. I think the best stuff about this show lies in the solid cast and Oscar Wilde's spectacularly funny play. The music highlights the right emotional moments, comic and otherwise, and it shows off the awesome Canadian talent onstage.\n\n*Earnest, the Importance of Being* plays at the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts until May 3rd.

        "body": "###1. What about *L’heure Espagnole* makes it an appealing choice for Stu&Jess Productions?\n\nRight now, when choosing which operas to produce, we are focusing on one-act operas that are highly entertaining with an interesting story to tell. Stu and I were initially drawn to *L'Heure* because of the score, Ravel's lush and varied orchestration. Stu in particular was hooked after hearing the opening few measures of just metronomes ticking away representing the clocks in the shop. \n\nNext came the story and the comedy. The plot is a hilarious comedy of errors: Torquemada is the clock maker of Toledo, Spain. On Thursdays, he goes out to wind and fix all the city clocks, and that is the day that his wife Concepcion has her lover Gonzalve over. On this particular Thursday however,  Concepcion gets a few more visitors than she would like, and a lot less action. \n\nEach of the five characters is incredibly quirky and the music in turn reflects their quirks perfectly. For example, Ramiro is the simple muleteer and his music can be very clunky. Don Inigo Gomez, the older banker, is often represented by a waltz. Each of the men in Concepcion's life, on this particular Thursday, represents a different type of man and love. Each has their own charms, and combined, would probably make the perfect man. However, on their own, each is a fantastic caricature of love. \n\n###2. Can you tell us about your choice of venue?\n\nWe used this same venue for our last production of Bizet's *Le Docteur Miracle*, and when we decided on *L'Heure*, we knew that this warehouse would be the perfect fit for our setting of it. The idea for Torquemada's clock shop is to make it look like a crazy inventor's shop- messy, gadgets and trinkets everywhere, dead plants, and of course, as many clocks as possible, none of them telling the same time. Think Maurice's basement workshop from Disney's *Beauty and the Beast*. \n\nThis warehouse also comes with a beautiful catwalk of wooden alleys and huge metal staircase. That staircase became the focal point of the design and it is used to carry Concepcion's lovers to and from her bedroom while encased in grandfather clocks. The space is also large enough to house our 28 piece orchestra as well as a good sized audience.\n\n###3. How does Stu&Jess Productions fit in with Montréal’s opera scene?\n\nWe originally chose to work in Montréal because of the singers that we knew here. *The Medium* was cast entirely of McGill students or graduates and all of our orchestra members were students as well. *L'Heure* will be our third production in Montreal. We have found a nice niche of students, singers, musicians, and artists here who are all interested in opera and curious about what we do. \n\nThe established companies here such as [Opera da Camera](http://www.operadacamera.ca/) and [La Compagnie Baroque Mont-Royal](https://cbmroyal.wordpress.com/) are all very supportive of one another and it has been nice getting to know them and sharing in their experiences. There is already a thriving arts scene here with regards to visual art, the jazz festival, and the indie music scene, and there are many classical music lovers. \n\nThere is definitely room for us to explore and grow here, plus the city itself is just fantastic! We are hoping to branch out to Vancouver (Stu's home) and Toronto (where Jess is from) as well in the future.\n\n###4. What kind of feedback have you gotten in previous seasons?\n\nPeople that come to see our shows are usually quite surprised at our venue choices. Often anticipating a more traditional setting, they arrive and have to walk up three flights of stairs, down a long and dark hallway to the warehouse, it's an exciting adventure. Then they walk into this huge space, see the orchestra set up, a neat set, and we hope that their curiosity is piqued. \n\nThe idea of doing opera in found spaces is not often done in Montréal, that we know of. The other opera companies here generally use theatrical spaces, which is great! However, we have managed to find some awesome hidden gems in which to house our productions, and the feedback has been so positive that it has inspired us to keep searching for new and special locations. For our inaugural production of Menotti's *The Medium*, we found an old church that a local artist had turned into his home. There, we housed an audience of 40 people as well as our 17 piece orchestra. It was crammed and intimate. However, it gave the feeling that the audience was part of Baba's séances along with our singers, and they really got experience her descent into madness WITH her. \n\nThe paper factory warehouse, while much larger than the church, is still incredibly atmospheric, and it allows both our orchestra and audience to grow in size. Acoustically, the warehouse is amazing because the floors are wood, the walls are brick, and the ceilings are 60 feet high. It's a magical chamber of sound.\n\n###5. If you’ve never seen an opera before, what makes *L’heure Espagnole* a good introduction?\n\nPlain and simply, *L'Heure* is a great starter opera because it's short (it runs around 45 minutes), it's hilarious, and the music is beautiful. It is an entertaining romp through this clock shop with some gorgeous reflective moments and a lot of sexual tension. \n\nWe are so excited to present this show: we have a great group of young and talented singers who have really brought this show to life and a huge, luscious orchestra. In addition to placing the audience in between the orchestra and the singers, we also make full use of the cat-walks up above so it is an all-emcompassing, surround sound experience. \n\nLastly, you can have a drink with you while you enjoy the show, which is always a bonus. Our hope is that the audience leaves having enjoyed their time with us and inspired to see more opera!",

When Ramiro, a muleteer, visits the clockshop to have his watch repaired, Concepción worries that his presence will ruin her rendezvous with the poet Gonzalve. To distract Ramiro, Concepción asks him to carry out various tasks. Another suitor, Don Inigo, arrives, and a hilarious attempt to hide the lovers from each other and smuggle each of them to her bedroom without Ramiro noticing ensues. Finally, Concepción--weary of her suitors' antics--exits with the virile muleteer. Torquemada returns, delighted to see so many eager customers with his wife.

The art is enormous and stunning, and the people who created opera are extraordinary folks. I knew that most people my age didn't have much exposure to opera, and it seemed like an obvious way to bridge the gap, to show just how *fascinating* it really is.\n\nOver the last year and a half, writing has become more rewarding than I ever anticipated; I've met way more artists, and seen many more shows. I started to look at my own industry differently, because I was able to ask *lots* of questions, and get lots of answers.\n\nWhen I decided to give the writing thing my full attention, it was a positive plan. Yes, I wouldn't be able to give the same amount of focus to my work as a pianist, but this decision was about pursuing something that had me truly excited, at a time when I was craving something new. I put the constant search for gigs on hold, and began to write, as full-time as I could.\n\nSo, when I realized that the last of my gigs (for the foreseeable future) was upon me, I really shouldn't have been that surprised, right? \n\nIt was a strange revelation, to realize that I didn't have anything on my plate to practice. I didn't *have* to get any music ready for a concert, I had no new opera to learn. The to-do list of practicing has been ubiquitous throughout my adult life, and the constancy was a comforting thing.\n\nThe work of any serious musician is ongoing and cumulative, and it becomes inseparable from her ongoing, cumulative life. For me, every spare moment would be spent tinkering with a few bars of whatever piece was currently taking up the most of my current mental space. I loved the evenings I had free, where I could dodge all social invites and spend a quiet, leisurely night of practicing my pile of scores. \n\nI suppose we all get philosophical when change is in the air, and after that \"last gig,\" I philosophized on my now very real decision to trade the piano for a laptop (keyboard for keyboard, really). I went from being a student, entirely enamoured of music and opera, to a professional turning my passion into a business; at that point, I couldn't help but start to ask new questions, which were mostly variants on \"why do it?\" \n\nNow, it's about getting these questions answered; it never occurred to me I could figure out the music business by stepping away from the piano for a while. I suppose that's perspective, seeing the forest for the trees. Unfamiliar as it may be, I can't argue with the clarity I've found, even in the infancy of my little blogging experiment.\n\n",

Several board members were surprised, claiming that the decision was premature and hadn't been fully discussed.\n\nThe board rebelled against the decision to shut down San Diego Opera, and about half of the members resigned. The Campbells were put on paid administrative leave, while the board reassembled into a more constructive state, eventually reviving the company.\n\nThis week, [documents outlining SDO's settlement with the Campbells](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2071291-opera-990.html) were released, showing that Ian Campbell was paid a lump sum of $276,000, and Ann Spira Campbell was paid $200,000. The settlement also required SDO to release the $594,697 in a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, set aside for Spira Campbell.\n\nThe Campbells also were gifted free tickets for life at San Diego Opera, for their own personal use.\n\nThe board explained the funds: \"A friend of the Opera, who has chosen to remain anonymous, donated the funds with the specific instruction that they be used to resolve all issues with the transition in leadership so that no other donors’ funds would be used for this purpose.\"\n\nIt seems a little like either a board member in support of the Campbells wanted to make sure they'd be well taken care of, or an exasperated board member throwing money at a situation to make it go away. Either way, the use of large sums of money like this, when we're talking about a poor industry fighting for funds, leaves a sour taste.\n\nThe story [showed up on Reddit, too](http://www.reddit.com/r/opera/comments/34s3n7/san_diego_opera_pays_1_million_to_pair_who/); one of the commenters left this:\n\n> \"Here's something I'll say, as someone who has sung with SDO, and was singing with them when all of this went down -\nThe free tickets for life were definitely a big ol' 'fuck you' from the company to the Campbells. They are only usable by the Campbells themselves, and they are so hated and reviled around here that they would never dare to show their face here again. I actually think they'd have to show ID and pick them up at Will Call, which is something I would pay to see.\"",

        "body": "Singers love to \"figure out\" the characters they play. Digging deep into a role becomes a sort of short-term obsession; they'll talk about their current (or favourite) opera character for ever and ever. They'll tell you all about what people *think* Don Giovanni or Violetta or Cavaradossi are all about, and then they'll tell you what they're *really like*. They've got the inside scoop, you see; they pore over every letter and every note of their role, trying to make it their own while living up to every legend who ever sang it before them.\n\nOh, the time you could spend on a mess like Don José, or whether or not Peter Grimes killed that boy, or or Musetta's secret laundry list of insecurities. Such *fodder* we have in our midst. I wonder, sometimes, if budding opera singers were always so eager to peel back the dramatic layers (real or otherwise) of their roles. It only does good for opera to have more skilled actors onstage. So, it's a great thing that acting lessons have become a staple for most young artist and summer training programs. I've noticed a funny side-effect, though, from my seat as a coach. \n\nSingers, particularly young singers, grow understandably attached to some of the roles they take on. Meaty characters like Figaro or the Countess are great examples, because their stories are timeless, and told in relatively few words; that leaves *lots* of room for interpretation. Combine that with the natural curiosity of an inspired student with nothing to do but learn, and it's a breeding ground for the Overthinker.\n\nLook, I'd usually take a neurotic, overthinking dramaphile over some of the Golden Oldies. Great as their voices were, no one really equates acting prowess with the likes of Pavarotti or Kiri Te Kanewa. Of course I want to listen to them all the time, but in some cases, these old greats [could be singing about anything](https://youtu.be/1-13t581Fzc). So when people like [Alice Coote](https://youtu.be/-26AS6DhHbY) (0:19, #slain) or [Gerald Finley](https://youtu.be/7fJRoKlCroU) come along and really *become* these characters, without sacrificing their singing, it reinvigorates these operas for their new fans. \n\nFast-forward to me sitting in a 1-hr coaching with a baritone who can't *stop* getting excited about the Count in *Le nozze di Figaro*, meaning he deconstructs for 45 minutes and he sings for less than 15. As inspired as he may be, most of his deconstructing will never relay to the audience; this isn't because he isn't capable of putting theory into practice, but because there are only so many emotional states one can actually play. Even fewer fit into the line that baritone is currently singing. \n\nI mean, how do you play, \"the Count is a smart guy who's not actually smart, he's more well-read but unwise, and he's fighting for what he thinks is right, but it's actually wrong, and it's not even about sleeping with Susanna, it's about beating Figaro (#winning), and he's in a marriage that grew stale and he wants to feel young again, like a man, but he's the stock villain in the story, because it's about class wars, and the Count is the establishment, except he was kind of a hero in *Il barbiere*....\"? Et cetera.\n\nTenors do this with the likes of Rodolfo in *La bohème* (who is a total romantic, except possessive of his girlfriend, because he's the product of old-school sexism in Italy, implanted into Bohemian life in France, and Mimì is a hussy anyway) and the Duke in *Rigoletto* (who has every right to live his life the way he wants, and it's not his fault that Gilda is emotionally 4 years old, and maybe he did really love her in that moment anyway, so how can he be villainized?). \n\nMezzos go mental with Carmen (the lady who oozes sex but she's not a whore, and she's got her own status and doesn't need Western civilization because she's a strong independent woman who won't be taken advantage of but she ends up jumping into bed with powerful men who give her things like freedom and fame).\n\nIt's only a problem when that baritone is so overloaded with concepts about this intriguing character, that he looks more like a deer in headlights rather than a Count while he sings.\n\n*You just can't be pleased, Jenna,* you sigh. *First you want people to **act**, goddammit, and now they're doing **too much** homework?*\n\nBasically, yeah. Perhaps it's to be expected that, with more focus on drama, and the huge amounts of recordings from which singers can learn, there's a pendulum swinging here. If you'll permit me to use extreme examples, we've swung from parking and barking, to heady, hand-wringing depictions of iconic characters. I'll grant that every performer is different, and maybe they're at home in the so-called overthought characterizations; and playing someone like Lulu is arguably more complicated than playing Barbarina.\n\nSo where's the sweet spot? It's not that hard to find, especially for singers with a bit of hindsight. What made you so fascinated with the character of Don Giovanni in the first place? Something pulled you in to find out more, and I think that point of entry is the sweet spot that you, the educated singer, can share with the (perhaps uneducated) listener. \n\nAll the background and all the presumed motivations you've discovered about this character will add to your performance, but only if that first step in the door is presented first. Don Giovanni may have a drug problem, or he may be secretly gay, or he may be grossly insecure, but you can *play* seduction. And that's enough, you know? Simplicity doesn't mean you put in less work, it just means you let the audience get interested on their own.\n\nLastly, you haven't failed if your audience doesn't pick up on Don José's bad mother issues or how Zerlina is clearly too young to be thinking about getting married anyway. Listeners may have a grand old time anyway, enjoying what they enjoy. They then head out for post-opera drinks and argue, and that's how you know you gave them a show.",

        "body": "Last night I was able to check off one of my must-sees. For a while I felt like the only opera fan in Toronto who hadn't seen Robert Lepage's double bill of *Bluebeard's Castle/Erwartung*, but I fixed that. The production couldn't have brought more hype along with it, and I usually try and ignore hype so that it doesn't skew my otherwise fine enjoyment of a production. The rumours turned out to be true, and I was amazed.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431189694639/Blubeard-MC-0102.jpg)\n<figcaption>John Relyea and Ekaterina Gubanova in Bluebeard's Castle. Photo: Michael Cooper</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI'm not even sure what to say about *Bluebeard's Castle*, other than I couldn't tear my eyes away. Michael Levine's set is a claustrophobic box of blackness, and Robert Thomson's ingenious lighting design helps us to see just enough of Bluebeard's dark world. I couldn't get over how uncluttered, yet how perfectly clear the design really was. The shadows from the castle's cate, the keyhole-shaped pools of light indicating the seven terrifying doors, it was specific enough to tell a clear story, and unspecific enough to change and morph as the story unravels.\n\nThose seven doors, too. It seems so simple to indicate with lighting the magnitude of Bluebeard's locked secrets; it may have been simple, but it was an arresting picture every time: red (torture chamber), gold (jewels), gleaming white (weapons), water ripples (lake of tears), and what seemed like the entire planet (Bluebeard's empire). \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431189716405/Blubeard-MC-0573.jpg)\n<figcaption>John Relyea and Ekaterina Gubanova in Blubeard's Castle. Photo: Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nJohn Relyea and Ekaterina Gubanova were totally stunning as Bluebeard and his new wife, Judith. The two sounded spectacular, making real art out of what is no doubt a tricky score. I found myself watching Relyea lurk around in the background, aided by a small travelling spotlight that followed Bluebeard throughout the show. I loved how in the blackness of the set, the pools of light distort one's perspective; one of the eeriest moments was when Judith was downstage, Bluebeard behind her, but I couldn't tell the distance between them.\n\nSpeaking of eerie (spoiler: fair warning), when those dead wives came out of the stage in bloodsoaked dresses (and I mean soaked), that was the first time I've been genuinely scared by live theatre. It was terrifying, and I again couldn't take my eyes off of any of it.\n\n*Bluebeard* had me asking questions in the intermission. I was drawn to Judith's repeated response when Bluebeard asks her why she needs to keep opening the doors: \"Because I love you,\" she says to him. It was a fascinating look at how a private man deals with external, almost unrelated pressure to open up his life to others. Bluebeard has an incredible journey from reluctance, to defiance, to resignation; the opening of each of the doors is punctuated with a question to Judith, \"are you afraid?\" I was.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431189727392/Erwartung-MC-0826.jpg)\n<figcaption>Krisztina Szabó as The Woman in Erwartung. Photo: Michael Cooper</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThen came *Erwartung*, and I got the heebie-jeebies almost immediately. Krisztina Szabó embodied The Woman, who relives a nightmarish scene of searching for the lover she lost (killed). In *Erwartung* there's insanity, a constant, nagging feeling that something is seriously wrong. I loved how Thomson and Levine traded *Bluebeard*'s darkness and claustrophobia for open space and oppressive white light; the space and light were no relief from *Bluebeard*, just unnerving in a new way. \n\nPerspective was off in *Erwartung*, what you thought was up is actually down. Schoenberg's constantly changing score and The Woman's insanity are great reasons to mess with an audience's point of reference; another great reason is that it is *terrifying*. The Woman's shrink, her past lover, the tree branch that she mistook for his body, they all slide sideways into our view via the big brick wall that doubles as a floor. It was like a David Lynch film, or like those staircases leading every which way. Mostly it was freaky, and it left us wondering how they pulled off some of those illusions. \n\n*Erwartung* is disjointed, yet has a clear narrative; the one true constant is The Woman. Krisztina Szabó stunned me again with this performance. In an interview she told me that *Erwartung* was by far the most difficult thing she's had to learn; she really did embody this role, though. There were no moments of \"just singing,\" everything meant something specific, every word was newly coloured. So incredible.\n\nThe COC Orchestra under Music Director Johannes Debus played spectacularly. For the players, these two operas are worlds apart; yet the orchestra too joined the organic melding of elements in this production. \n\nWhen I interviewed revival director François Racine, I asked him why this double-bill has seen such success over its 20 years. He replied simply, \"Because it's brilliant.\" That's all there really is to it. Lepage and his team brought us two entirely integrated works of art, where no piece of the puzzle can be removed without the whole thing falling apart. I *love* stuff like that, especially when every singular element is so brilliantly presented. \n\nWhat a night. Go see *Bluebeard's Castle/Erwartung*, don't ask questions.

For a while I felt like the only opera fan in Toronto who hadn't seen Robert Lepage's double bill of Bluebeard's Castle/Erwartung, but I fixed that. The production couldn't have brought more hype along with it, and I usually try and ignore hype so that it doesn't skew my otherwise fine enjoyment of a production. The rumours turned out to be true, and I was amazed.",

One of their programs is [Living Opera](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/Schools/LivingOpera.aspx), which gives a class of secondary school students a chance to hear voice and drama workshops, tour the Four Seasons Centre, and see one of the mainstage shows. If it sounds exciting for high school students, you're right.\n\nYesterday's Living Opera focused on *The Barber of Seville*, and students came from [Notre Dame Catholic High School](http://notredame.dcdsb.ca/) in Ajax. After an introduction to opera and Rossini, and a quick refresher of the plot of *Barber*, students had the chance to learn some singing technique with voice teacher [Mark Joelson Daboll](http://pleasejudgeme.com/). \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431188797798/LivingOpera4.jpg)\n<figcaption>Notre Dame Catholic High School students act out the plot of *The Barber of Seville*</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nMany of the students were at the opera for the first time yesterday, but a few are more familiar. I asked a few Notre Dame students about what they learned. \"I enjoyed all of this. I do like the warm-ups; he's teaching me how to warm up, how to extend the ranges. It's brilliant,\" says Notre Dame student Robbie Macatangay, who has been to Living Opera workshops in the past. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431188812146/LivingOpera.jpg)\n<figcaption>Mark Joelson Daboll talks breath support.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFellow student Victoria Cozza is also a bit of a veteran: \"I've been to two of these before, and I guess [Mark Daboll] really shows us how to properly warm up our voices and I like the way he uses techniques. I'm actually considering getting into opera and singing and stuff, so it's really interesting to me.\"\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431188823122/LivingOpera2.jpg)\n<figcaption>Mark Joelson Daboll leads a Living Opera vocal workshop.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe best part of offering an inside, up-close look at opera for young people, is that seeing an actual show becomes *way* more interesting. I was curious about how the workhop and tour would get the students jazzed to see *Barber*. Notre Dame student Ann Marie Jones was sold before she walked into the Four Seasons Centre. \"I've just seen the posters outside and it looks kind of crazy and fun and quirky.\" \n\nA quick refresher on the plot can count for a lot, too. \"I like how they explain what's going on and stuff,\" says Victoria, because it's not always to understand in Italian.\"\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431188843481/LivingOpera5.jpg)\n<figcaption>Notre Dame Catholic High School students explore the Four Seasons Centre.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOf course, you can't beat the music. I asked Robbie what excited him most about seeing *The Barber of Seville*: \"I'm looking forward to the *infamous* arias they'll perform.\"\n\nLiving Opera is one of many Education & Outreach programs offered by the Canadian Opera Company.

        "body": "###1. What kind of presence do you find singers bring to a photo shoot? \n\n**Dario**: Everyone brings their own particular presence and aura to a shoot. My goal is to find the essence of that person, whether it’s the smile, the directness, the eye contact, the hands, the body position, etc. I think that's how I never duplicate anything, I have been blessed to work with so many wonderful people and their trust in me is what makes the photo shoot successful.\n\n**Bo**: Compared to other musicians, most of the singers I work with are more lively and they love to talk!\n\n**Emily**: I try to make them comfortable, so they have time to bring out their personality out and into their portraits. Mostly, I want to bring our their confidence and friendliness into the camera, all the while looking effortless natural. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431379164757/Anna-Netrebko-by-Dario-Acosta-3.jpg)\n<figcaption>Soprano Anna Netrebko, photographed by Dario Acosta</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n###2. What does good photography do for a singer's career? Do you adapt your work to the needs of a singer, versus a pianist, etc.? \n\n**Emily**: As a trained singer myself, I think good photography reflects a lot on the seriousness of a singer's ambition and confidence level. Our face is the stage where we play out our emotions, and we will be judged, whether we like it or not. I try to make singers look less \"serious\" and less model-like with a blank canvas, but more like someone you want to meet and have a conversion with, and someone so nice that would want to hire.\n \n**Bo**: Just through my pictures alone, without ever having the experience of their sound, I want to inspire curiosity and desire in you to go and experience live what each of my subjects are capable of doing on stage.\n \nAn instrumentalist has an external instrument which is absent from a singer. Therefore, it is more important to capture their state of being by watching their face and body.\n\n**Dario**: Well, I think it’s important to acknowledge that above all it’s the singers' singing that is most important to their career, *but* a bad photographer can really make a singer look bad. The general audience is very very photo-savvy now. Even if they don’t know exactly why a photo is bad, they can pick out a good photo from a bad one. It only benefits the singer/instrumentalist to always have their best foot forward. We all have bad pics of ourselves and good pics of ourselves, and the singer/instrumentalist should only show their good side, just like they wouldn’t want to give a bad performance. \n\nYes, singers and instrumentalists are a bit different in needs, but fundamentally I look for their personality as I approach the session. Instrumentalists might need to have their instrument with them, so I need to figure out a way to convey what they do and their instrument in the photo without being “cliché” and boring and expected. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431367668161/osborne4.jpg)\n<figcaption> Canadian soprano Simone Osborne, photographed by Bo Huang.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n###3. What do you think is in common between a singer's stage presence in performance, and their getting the most out of a photo shoot?\n\n**Bo**: A singer is most confident when singing. What I look for in the photo shoot is that same confidence and presence which can be hidden when they are off stage.\n\n**Dario**: There is really nothing in common with a photo shoot and a stage performance. Usually on stage they are performing a character and have not only the music and technique but the staging and acting to think about. On a photo shoot (unless we are going for something character-driven), it's all about the person, the movements are much more fine tuned, the placement of the hands, the tilt of the head, the angle which I shoot at is all highly fine tuned and not broad. \n\nOn stage they try to make everyone in the hall feel their presence, and in the photo shoot it's really all about them and the one person at a time that's viewing the photo; the connection is much more intimate, the approach is much more intimate. We end up really connecting by the end of the shoot. \n\n**Emily**: Some people like their photos taken, and some don't. The latter may take longer to feel comfortable at a photo session, but more often I have worked with clients who are really pleasantly surprised that they liked their photos. I do see a parallel in term of performing on stage as a singer and \"performing\" into the camera, the common thread is that how we judge ourselves and our body often reflects how we judge our performance and body. Perhaps I am wrong--and I hope I am wrong. \n\nSometimes it takes a different perspective to tell us that we look great (that's my job, and I do think that, and each can look and feel fabulous, even if it takes a little of teasing). I think that's the same conclusion I can take away in a performance--don't judge yourself too harshly. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431368606439/ClaireEmilyDing.jpg)\n<figcaption>Claire de Sévigné, photographed by Emily Ding</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n###4. What do you enjoy about working with opera singers? \n\n**Dario**: Opera singers and classical musicians and conductors and everyone involved in the art form are, above all, artists. There is a wonderful appreciation of each other at the photo shoot. They come in understanding that we are collaborating, and they truly trust me; that trust I cherish and feel highly responsible to create something meaningful. I admire the hard work that they put into the art form. When we meet for a shoot there's a mutual respect, it never feels like we are working, but like we are playing. I am never dreading going into the shoot. I'm always anticipating what the day will bring, and I am honored to work with the worlds greatest singers and musicians. I know at the end of the day we will produce amazing work together. \n\n**Bo**: Each one is filled with unique charisma! Being in their company makes me happy!\n\n**Emily**: I love opera singers, in general I think we are a rambunctious bunch. We are warm and outgoing people, and the end of each photo shoot I feel that I have spent an hour with a new friend. \n",

        "body": "On Sunday, I was lucky enough to find myself invited to a small private recital by two of the best young singers in the country (there, I said it). Sopranos, and besties, Claire de Sevigne and Aviva Fortunata treated us to an intimate recital before they split up for about a year; Claire travels to Salzburg and Zürich, and Aviva heads out to dominate the 2015 Cardiff Singer of the World competition.\n\nI found myself in a lovely apartment seated next to an impressive marble fireplace. There was an apartment grand about ten feet ahead of me and a big projection screen showing candid and behind-the-scenes shots of these two fabulous mademoiselles of music. The title \"Best friends, Deal with It\", let me know that I was definitely going to get a whole bunch of Claire and Aviva's charming personalities throughout the afternoon. \n\nFrom what I remembered of their voices I had a fleeting moment of being concerned that I may get pummelled by sound. I should have known better. These two ladies seriously have chops and know how to a) play to their hall and b) play to their audience.\n\nWith Schmopera's own Jenna Douglas at the piano, the program was a light-hearted, extremely funny romp through some fabulous repertoire sung by some fabulous singers. This really was one of the highlights of my season, and I almost missed out on it. They opened the show with a lovely video montage of friends, colleagues and family commenting candidly on their relationship with the sopranos and the girls' relationship with each other, and then launched into a delicious \"Sull'aria\" from Mozart's *Le nozze di Figaro* - one of my all-time favourite duets.\n\nThere was Mozart and Mendelssohn, and a wonderful musical theatre medley that closed the night, even featuring original music by Ms. Fortunata herself.  I do have to give it up, though, to the a medley right before the intermission: it was a mash-up of all the duets these two sopranos will never get to sing together (*L'incoronazione di Poppea*, *La bohème*, my personal favourite, *Ruddigore*, in which they NAILED some of the hardest patter in the canon, and many many more). It's a number that would be the perfect finale to almost any large scale recital, gala, and I'm hoping the girls get the chance to record it for posterity. It really was truly brilliant. Honestly, I haven't laughed this hard in a while. \n\nThis is exactly the kind of show that should be put up in pubs (Opera Bob's?) and done for more public audiences. It's recitals like this I think are what we need to get opera back into the hands (and ears) of the general public. The show is contemporary, entertaining, and leaves the audience begging for more. \n\nPlease come back soon and sing all this again for us!!",

        "body": "\n**Jenna**: Tuesday night, Greg & I went to hear the [Talisker Players](http://www.taliskerplayers.ca/) at Trinity-St. Paul's on Bloor. The Players' chamber series is always a guarantee for great performances and interesting programming, and this concert was no exception. Entitled *Heroes, Gods & Mortals*, the programme included two of my favourite singers to watch: [Carla Huhtanen](http://www.carlahuhtanen.com/) and [Andrea Ludwig](http://andrealudwig.ca/).\n\nThe rep had Greek mythology in common; music about Hercules, Aphrodite, Leda, Orpheus & Venus made up an impressive night. Actor Ross Manson read poetry and monologues to set up each piece. I like this touch in Talisker's series; the moments of spoken word act like aural sorbet (plus, Manson has a satisfyingly clear speaking voice).\n\n**Greg**: I have to say that I've always really enjoyed the [Talisker Players](http://www.taliskerplayers.ca/)' shows that I've seen. They players are always top-notch, and play so well as an ensemble. Tuesday night was no exception. *Heroes, Gods, and Mortals* definitely lived up to the high standard of quality I expect from such a fantastic group of artists. \n\n**Jenna**: The two singers alternated six pieces on the program, all of which were substantial, stand-alone works. Carla Huhtanen began the night with Alan Hovhaness' stunningly beautiful *Hercules*, with Elizabeth Loewen Andrews on violin. The piece sucked me right in, and Carla's performance was incredible. She showed technical mastery in a very un-boring way, with all of the pitch bending, straight tone and chest voice written into the part; it made the excxitement factor that much greater when Carla bloomed into her full top, which is some of the most exciting sound I've ever heard live.\n\n**Greg**: First up Ms. Carla sang *Hercules* by Alan Hohvaness. This was a lovely setting for soprano and solo violin. I really enjoyed the juxaposition and the use of glissandi to evoke an earlier time in music. Carla's skill in this kind of repertoire is unparalleled and she was able to create some of the most beautiful colours that blended and danced with Elizabeth Loewen Andrews violin. My favourite part was the energetic finale with tinges of Mediterranean gypsy and Armenian dance modes. \n\n**Jenna**: Andrea Ludwig began with John Plant's *Invocation to Aphrodite*. The Greek poem by Sappho herself was super sexy, asking Aphrodite for good luck with a lady (or if not luck, victory). With the piano quintet of Talisker players, Andrea sang with a clear, metallic mezzo sound, and she hung some beautiful high notes in Plant's eerie and feminine sound palate. I loved Andrea's two voices, her queen-like Aphrodite, and her throatier, more desperate-sounding Sappho.\n\n**Greg**: This was a lovely setting in the original classical greek. Andrea Ludwig's impressive range and colour wove it's way throughout the piece giving us glimpses of a bright sparkling top and a warm easy middle and chest. The string quartet and piano played extremely well (as always) and the music made between the six was top notch. \n\n**Jenna**: Carla came back for excerpts of Joaquin Turina's *Las Musas de Andalucia*, with the Talisker Players forming a piano quintet (Elizabeth Loewen Andrews, bijan Sepanji, violins, Mary McGeer, viola, Laura Jones, cello, and Peter Longworth, piano). Again, Carla sounded full and powerful; Turina writes in this very declamatory way, but free like Italian verismo. There was wonderful chamber music happening with this piece; the quintet was hugely flexible, in that way that you can see happening on the fly. It doesn't sound like much, but seeing this level of communication between musicians live is a thrilling thing.\n\n**Greg**: I love me some Spanish composers. They always seem to be the most adept at infusing their cultures and traditions into their contemporary pieces. This piece really showed of the more full-lyric side of Huhtanen's voice and it's a side I really like seeing. \n\n**Jenna**: Speaking of sexy songs, Andrea came back for Monica Pearce's *Leda Songs*, set to text by Rilke, H.D. and D.H. Lawrence about the mythological woman who is seduced by Zeus in the form of a swan. Bijan Sepanji, Mary McGeer, and Laura Jones made up the string trio, with Peter Stoll on clarinet. The score was full of neat sound effects, and constant smooth, swan-on-the-water aesthetic. I thought Andrea adapted her sound beautifully, singing with a more feminine sound for these songs.\n\n**Greg**: *Leda Songs* was probably the most existential/ethereal piece. Relentless harmonics and high-pitched long tones wove in and out with sparsely placed percussive aspects via a bass clarinet and the cello. I liked the piece, I felt it could use with a little more rhythmic variety. I felt like it was very easy to get lost in the piece as much of it sounded very similar. The execution of it however, was top-drawer once again and made my question why I hadn't heard more from Andrea in the past.  \n\n**Jenna**: Carla finished her night with two recits and two arias from Pergolesi's *Orfeo*, which I hadn't heard before. David Sandall joined the Talisker Players on harpsichord. It was a treat to hear her in a genre that she sings just as well as new music. She had great ornaments and she was fascinating to watch. Also a bonus: Carla Huhtanen in a pants role. \n\n**Greg**: Carla's final piece of the night was probably the one most in her wheelhouse. A selection of recitatives and arias from Pergolesi's *Orfeo*. So great to hear Carla sing a pants role and really let her coloratura fly. The quartet and harpsichord played exquisitely, perfectly recreating the feeling that I was in the salon of some Duke, Prince or wealthy Lord enjoying some private entertainments after a delicious banquet. This was the highlight of the night for me. If you get the chance to hear Carla sing early music, do yourself a favour and go. You won't be disappointed. \n\n**Jenna**: Andrea's final set was *Songs from One Touch of Venus*, by Kurt Weill and arranged by the Talisker Players' cellist, Laura Jones. I love Weill songs for what they are, with incredible texts by Ogden Nash, and dirty harmonies over back-ended beats. I thought this arrangement was pretty clean, maybe too clean for Weill; but Jones' orchestration made these songs much more transparent and gentle. Andrea sang with a clear, speechy sound, and made it easy for us to get every important word. I wanted a bit more dirt from her, both as a singer and as an actor; perhaps adapting to this lighter arrangement, Andrea sang these Weill songs a little too well.\n\n**Greg**: The show closed with Ms. Ludwig presenting a selection of four songs from Kurt Weill's *One Touch of Venus*, with lyrics by Ogden Nash in a new arrangement by Talisker cellist Laura Jones. I love Kurt Weill (and I'm very picky about it) so I was keen to see Talisker's take on it. The arrangement suffered a bit from the lack of piano or percussiveness which I feel is key to creating, finding and keeping the pocket which is the driving force of any Weill tune. I coined the phrase \"The Weill is in the vamp\" with Jenna that night. I also thought the delivery was a little too whitewashed and cutesy. Andrea sang them very well with exquisite technique, but there was some of Weill's characteristic darkness that was missing and I think it was the missing link in what could be a very interesting take on one of my favourite composers. \n\n**Greg**: Overall, do yourself a favour and check them out. Talisker always puts on a fantastic show of the highest quality - I had to remind myself regularly that I wasn't listening to a recording - and it's a shame that people aren't clamouring to get in the door to these things. Hopefully we at Schmopera can help a little there, because people need to be hearing this stuff. Bravi Tutti!\n\n**Jenna**: Like Greg says, these concerts should be packed. The artists are fantastic, and their programming is endlessly fascinating; I always hear something entirely new. The [Talisker Players](http://www.taliskerplayers.ca/) has wrapped up their 14th season, so be keep an eye out for the 15th.",

Basses are basses because they've been singing forever; they're also old dudes, and old dudes like fishing.\n\n2. Sopranos are thinking about themselves being onstage while they're onstage. I suppose there's a fine line between self-involvement and having your head in the game.\n\n3. Baritones are particularly concerned with voice placement. That's funny to me, because there's also a tenor in this comic strip.\n\n4. Mezzos are attracted to men who sing in manly tones. Can't really argue with that.\n\n5. Tenors get paid a lot.\n\nI do get the jokes. Stereotypes for a reason, and all that. It's interesting to note that even if singers of different voice-types don't align perfectly with the above cross-section, there are still a few fach-specific thought processes that I've noticed from my seat at the piano. \n\n**Basses**: If they're young, people are skeptical. \"He's a baritone, he just doesn't have his passaggio figured out yet,\", or, \"Vocal fry doesn't equal low notes\". So they (like many young singers) are in the business of convincing their bosses about their fach, probably more than they're thinking about after-work activities. If they're experienced basses, they're also used to roles that are crucial but forgettable (as one bass put it, \"gods, villains, old men, and losers\". Sometimes they spend a whole rehearsal where the director rarely pays attention to them, and they're left to their own devices. So eventually they get bored and think about things like motorcycles and fishing.\n\n**Sopranos**: They're pretty aware of the fact that they're a dime a dozen, and so they're rightly after that *je ne sais quoi*, that presence that sets them apart from the billions of lyrics or soubrettes. Often they're a lead role, too, so the pressure is on. They get in their head, they get insecure, and they appear diva-esque. Or, they're playing a role that takes a lot out of a girl. Singing Cio-Cio San has got to be exhausting. On the other hand, if it walks like a diva...\n\n**Baritones**: Baritones tend to get either a) roles that have great music but precious little of it or b) roles that have lots of stage time but not much singing-singing. They're either feathered up as Papageno, getting laughs while trying to avoid woofing a role written for a non-singer, or they sing big old scenes between awkwardly long waiting periods. So, they're trying to get bang for their buck in terms of singing time, all while making sure they sound appropriately aged or mean. Cue the placement over-thinking.\n\n**Mezzos**: Ah, mezzos. The young man, the old woman, the soprano's friend, the evil stepmother, the maid, the whore, the bearded lady, it goes on and on. Plus, everyone's always leaning in to hear how they negotiate the chest voice. (\"She's no Marilyn Horne,\" and other unnecessities.) Mezzos are often in a similar boat as baritones; they have fewer chances to show everyone what they can do, and they've got to do in serious character. Really, put two singers in a room and ask them both to be slightly seductive and villainous, and sparks will probably fly. Plus, those low voices can be aphrodesiacs. \n\n**Tenors**: Do they really worry about money? Not much more than any other singer. But high notes, *yes*. This is their identity. Crack too many high notes and experts from all walks of live appear out of nowhere. \"Tenor without a top,\" opera-types love to quip. They've got high Cs in Rossini, peer-pressure high-Cs in Puccini, the gamble-of-a-high-C in Verdi, *nine* of them elsewhere. So yeah, they're worried what you're going to say about their high notes. Because we don't shut up about them.\n\n>There may be plenty of singers that merit these stereotypes, but there are many more who have fabulous senses of humour about \"singer-isms\" that pop up during rehearsal (I first saw this comic on a voice teacher's studio door). So, readers, what have I missed? Leave your laughable stereotypes in the comments below. ",

TMT presents Rameau's *Les Indes Mécaniques (ou Les Automates de Topkapi)*, a delightfully bizarre opera about girls and boys, and how they end up with each other.\n\nI didn't know the piece at all, so I had no expectations; my curiosity was piqued right away. Dorothéa Ventura, the sole singer in Rameau's opera, pulls two white sheets to uncover a frozen Baroque scene. Two harpsichordists, Loris Barrucand and Clément Geoffroy, sit at two harpsichords, with three curiously dressed dancers, Bruno Benne, Mickaël Bouffard, and Marie-Nathalie Lacoursière. The latter two, I noticed, had also directed and choreographed the piece.\n\nAfter Ventura winds them up with a noisemaker-crank, the frozen figures come to life; they're robots first, dancing with that rigid bounce and glitch-like wrist flicks, then as real people as their masks are removed. Ventura had only four arias to sing, but she kept busy as a dancer, making up a quartet with her three *automates*. *Les Indes* is a piece that reminded me just how versatile the artists in early opera really were, rivalling the triple-threat of today's music theatre singers. Ventura sang, danced, and played harpsichord throughout the show, and Lacoursière broke out the recorder between dances.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed by the Barrucand and Geoffroy on harpsichord; they played as an expert duo, pulling out so many colours from their instruments that they had an orchestra feel. I loved that they became part of the action, even leaving their harpsichords to the ladies as they tried on their dancing shoes.\n\n*Les Indes* was a hit for me. I loved the concept of unveiling a magical world, getting to know its magical people, and then closing the book when the clock strikes midnight. Ventura moved, sang, and played with ease, and she was constantly \"in character.\" Bravi, team.\n\nThe second half of Toronto Masque's show was *The Anahtar Project*, a concert of traditional Turkish music led by cellist and composer Andrew Downing. If this sounds like a non-sequitur, it's not; there were nods to the Turks (and the East in general) in the Rameau, and let's not forget that time in the 18th-century where it wasn't cool if it wasn't Turkish. \n\nFor a set of Turkish folk songs and some of his own compositions, Downing was joined by singer Brenna MacCrimmon, clarinetist Peter Lutek, percussionist Ben Grossman, and Demetrios Petsalakis on [oud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oud) (Turkish lute). *Anahtar* couldn't have been more different, aurally or visually, from the Rameau. I couldn't help but sense that this concert was in the wrong setting for this kind of music; the improvisatory feel of the group, handing solos back and forth and meeting at musical checkpoints, the players seemed casual about their performance. So, it felt odd to be seeing this kind of dynamic in a quiet, dark theatre. \n\nI have to hand it to Artistic Director Larry Beckwith, for combining an unlikely pair of performances, at the beautiful Harbourfront Centre. He certainly brought in experts for both *Les Indes* and *Anahtar*, and I am encouraged by companies like Toronto Masque Theatre, who put the art first.\n\nYou can catch their final performance tonight at 8pm at the Fleck Dance Theatre, Harbourfront Centre.

So, I went to work finding some opera on the *Late Show*, as my small but mighty nod to Letterman and his 33-year career (22 years on CBS, 11 on NBC).\n\nFirst up: Renée Fleming sings Letterman's Top 10. \n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CSSXzN2-vWY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nOn a more serious note, Letterman had Jessye Norman on last year. The interview is below, and you can [click here to watch her sing \"Midnight Special.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7rkTYFN6h8&spfreload=1) How fun would it have been for her to bust out some Wagner? Maybe a few years earlier...\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ea9KNQVArMs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nThat's sort of it for opera and Letterman, unless you count [this impersonal (and poorly excerpted) promo spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeTUKffXtjc) for the Metropolitan Opera's 2007 *Il barbiere di Siviglia*.\n\nI can't really argue with the three-decade career in show business, though. Letterman isn't my favourite late-night host, but I think there's something to be said for longevity. Maybe some more of this \"fine arts\" stuff will make it on to *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, set to succeed Letterman post-retirement. [Colbert likes opera](http://www.ovguide.com/tv_episode/the-colbert-report-season-4-episode-61-nathan-gunn-365962), after all.\n\nWe'll miss you, David!",

        "body": "After much hype and *much* rehearsal, the young artists of the Canadian Opera Company Ensemble Studio had their go at *The Barber of Seville* on the Four Seasons Centre Stage. This is a yearly offering for the Ensemble Studio; for one performance a year, they step into the roles of a mainstage production, which they've also been following as understudies. As much as there's the obvious hard work involved, this performance is always a bit special. The audience is filled with family and friends of the cast, and everyone is aware that we're seeing a very tangible product of these young singers' growing skills. Because I'm one of these invested friends (and I got to see [a few previews of the show](/a-preview-of-the-barber-of-seville-from-the-coc-ensemble-studio/)) I won't attempt to give an unbiased review of the show. \n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431790207959/BarberES-MC-3225.jpg)\n<figcaption>Iain MacNeil as Bartolo, and Clarence Frazer as Figaro. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nBaritone [Clarence Frazer](/scene/people/clarence-frazer/) was lucky enough to get a few extra performances of Figaro in the last week, having stepped in twice for Joshua Hopkins. The comfort was visible throughout the show, plus I think Clarence *really* likes being Figaro. He sounds the best I've heard him yet, and he embraced the aesthetic of the production by Joan Font and Els Comediants. Big gestures, light on his feet, finding all the humour among the singing. \n\n[Charlotte Burrage](/scene/people/charlotte-burrage/) sang her first coloratura role as Rosina; she too sounded the best I've heard her. She had an easy top and warm low notes. I heard a lot of growth in Charlotte's voice; the lightness she used for her coloratura had some beautiful effects on the rest of her singing. Rosina was a great catalyst for Charlotte's acting, too, and she showed us that mezzos can be funny.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431790226794/BarberES-MC-3047.jpg)\n<figcaption>Charlotte Burrage as Rosina and Andrew Haji as Almaviva. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nTenors [Andrew Haji](/scene/people/andrew-haji/) and [Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure](/scene/people/jean-philippe-fortier-lazure/) shared the role of Count Almaviva. I think it's great that the COC Ensemble opens up important roles like this to more than one singer who could benefit from the experience. I've noticed, though, that this is the second Ensemble show in a row where the second set of castmates shows up just as their characters are supposed to be in disguise (last year's *Così fan tutte* feature two sets of lovers, hilariously complicated in a meta way by the fact that the men are dressed up as Albanians, and *also new people*). Quite a test for the audience's pre-show homework. \n\nThat said, both Haji and Fortier-Lazure suited Almaviva in entirely different ways. Haji has a clear, growing ring to his sound, which he negotiated wisely in his impressive coloratura. Jean-Philippe made his mainstage debut in Act II, and he was a total riot. I loved how he moved as \"Don Alonso\", loved the air-piano bit, and I thought he had great comic chops. He has a throatier, darker sound than Haji, which I thought made him a particularly endearing Count.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431792681876/BarberES-MC-3363.jpg)\n<figcaption>Charlotte Burrage as Rosina and Jean-Philippe Fortier-Lazure as Almaviva. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAs is often the case, the supporting roles were total gems. It was great to hear Jan Vaculik outside of the COC Chorus; he boasted a beautiful baritone sound as Fiorello and the Officer. [Karine Boucher](/scene/people/karine-boucher/) was sassy and bored as Berta, and she sang that annoyingly tricky aria with a funny version of her beautiful sound. [Gordon Bintner](/scene/people/gordon-bintner/) was a total hoot as Don Basilio; you can tell Gordon has a dance background; he moved in such an overly-graceful, cartoon-like way, leading with his long legs or even longer prosthetic nose. His \"La calunnia\" was flawless. [Iain MacNeil](/scene/people/iain-macneil/) as Bartolo was a highlight for me. He had total ease in Italian, which basically solves 80% of the problems with this unforgiving role. Iain has grown enormously during this first year of his in the Ensemble Studio; this is a big task to give an artist of his age, and Iain admirably stepped up to the plate.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1431793578069/BarberES-MC-2664.jpg)\n<figcaption>Iain MacNeil as Bartolo and Gordon Bintner as Don Basilio. Photo by Michael Cooper.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI say bravi to the whole gang for a) a great show, and b) pulling it off with enormous amounts of hard work, taking notes from everyone and their mother, and just one rehearsal on the stage with orchestra. The Ensemble's journey from rehearsal day one to show night is arguably more difficult to pull off than the mainstage cast. Ensemblers, you deserve lots of sleep and a few beverages of your choice.

        "body": "Artists are such neat people because they're a creative bunch, not an organized bunch. Good, employable artists know that they can't be flighty, or bad at returning emails, or constantly late; yet it's not hard for me to imagine the artist that, left to his or her own devices, would probably keep odd and inconsistent hours, a messy workspace, and they'd occasionally get wrapped up in their work enough to forget to buy groceries. \n\nThis is fine and often charming, since the creative work gets done all the same. But I'd like to talk a bit about administrative work for a moment.\n\n>More often than not, artists are the ones who are inspired to start these performance outlets, and they take on the brunt of the organizational role.\n\nIn the opera world, performance outlets like [schools](/entire-mfa-class-drops-out-of-usc/), summer programs, festivals and opera houses all have administrative departments of varying sizes. There's never enough money in the arts, and it's can be considered luxurious, in a way, to have a group of people dedicated strictly to administration, free from artists doing double duty as scheduler or publicist. More often than not, artists are the ones who are inspired to start these performance outlets, and they take on the brunt of the organizational role. So, take a dearth of money, a small but mighty leadership team, and probably very little real administrative training, and the results are unpredictable.\n\n###The problems\n\nThis is all really only relevant because it can negatively effect the development of young singers, pianists, directors, and conductors. Perhaps not in the same way as a doing-more-harm-than-good-type of voice teacher, but it matters. It's not even about the staples like getting paying staff on time or adhering to contracts. \n- Small-seeming things like schedule conflicts can stress people out; singers might be double-booked for a rehearsal and a lesson, and they might or might not get to decide which one to attend. \n- Poor or little communication about accommodation and travel details aren't great either; artists can end up paying more for flights/trains, etc., waiting for the full picture and the go-ahead from Opera Administration. \n- Singers might not get the heads-up that they should have packed a tux, or *specifically not a tux*, or a towel, or flip-flops for the shower; these are avoidable annoyances that can translate into an artist's mood, which can bleed into their work, ultimately hindering the point of it all.\n\nPoorly organized administration in the performing arts is common, enough for frequent conversation material over drinks. Given that money is a constant hurdle, I think that the problems come from artistic people doing work that a) they're not fully trained to do, and b) for which they're not really the type. It's not a matter of being ill-equipped, but it's often a matter of being stretched too thin. The arts is a subjective business, but administration needs to stay objective; it's hard to stay objective when there's too much on your plate, and you're fielding questions and complaints on top of it all.\n\n###The solutions\n\nI think personnel costs for an administrative department should hold a higher place in line when its time to divvy up the company's expenses. Having a team of trained, objective administrators does arguably more good for young professionals than an expensive production in a pricey theatre, for example.\\* I get the urge, perhaps the need, for leadership to take on some of their own admin work, or having a particularly organized friend take care of the schedule. But this stuff really matters, not only for the humane treatment of your artists' day-to-day life, but for the reputation of the company. This world is small, and stories of poor communication and a few ignored emails in a row can result in some unofficial (but powerful) bad press.\n\nWhat’s to be done? Rearrange the frustratingly small amount of money available for the arts. I think that frankly, if you’ve run out of money for at least one professional, objective administrator, you went over-budget a while back. Young artists in particular can be left with few good options for work; if singers don’t want to work with disorganized bosses, that leaves a big leap to get gigs with larger, better-funded companies who have more pros on hand getting things done. Of course, if you’re an artsy-type who really does have a handle on your admin duties, I applaud you for taking on two huge jobs. This is another reason that arts administration is gaining more value in post-secondary music education, because as an individual entrepreneur or as a company, the music has to stop once in a while in order to raise money and deal with your crowded inbox.\n\n\\*Whether we're talking about a places to create opera, professional or otherwise, there could be a few financial/artistic trade-offs that could help the artists without hurting the artistic experience; community outreach performances, for example, could make use of (read: employ) more artists while keeping overhead and production costs lower with smaller, pared down, portable shows.\n\n",

An entire class of Masters of Fine Arts students has withdrawn from their degrees, after ongoing administrative struggles, including misinformation and changes to the terms of their program.\n\nIn a statement found [here](http://www.artandeducation.net/school_watch/entire-usc-mfa-1st-year-class-is-dropping-out/) and [here](http://mfanomfa.tumblr.com/), the group of seven artists provide a detailed account of why they \"are returning to the workforce degree-less and debt-full.\"\n\nFormer MFA students Julie Beaufils, Sid Duenas, George Egerton-Warburton, Edie Fake, Lauren Davis Fisher, Lee Relvas, and Ellen Schafer claim, among other things, that the terms of their tuition funding changed drastically from what they had been promised upon admission to USC. Initially, upon acceptance the students were promised their first year of tuition would be partially funded by scholarships, and their second would include a TA position, fully-funded tuition, benefits, and a stipend. Instead, the seven students found out that they would be competing for these TA positions which they had been promised, and competing for them with a larger group of students. The curriculum had changed, too, and \"the program lost a prominent artist, mentor, and tenured Roski professor, her pedagogical energies and input devalued by the administration.\"\n\nWhen the students questioned the administration about all of this, \"we were then told by the vice provost for Graduate Programs that the communication we received during recruitment clearly stating our funding packages was an 'unfortunate mistake,\" and that if the program wasn’t right for us, we “should leave.”\n\nI wait expectantly for USC to address this issue in an official setting. I'm interested in this story for the easy parallels of MFA to any post-graduate music education; these students sought out a program for its quality and funding, and no one but the class themselves seemed to care much that these things were soon taken off the table. I sense a connection between the dismissive (read: apathetic) response by the USC administration and the larger problem of undervaluing the arts.\n\n>\"We each made life-changing decisions to leave jobs and homes in other parts of the country and the world to work with inspiring faculty and, most of all, have the time and space to grow as artists. We trusted the institution to follow through on its promises. Instead, we became devalued pawns in the university’s administrative games. We feel betrayed, exhausted, disrespected, and cheated by USC of our time, focus, and investment. Whatever artistic work we created this spring semester was achieved in spite of, not because of, the institution. Because the university refused to honor its promises to us, we are returning to the workforce degree-less and debt-full.\"\n\nTheir Tumblr page is sparse yet clear: [MFA NO MFA](http://mfanomfa.tumblr.com/).",

        "body": "In an earlier post, I was hunting for operatic tributes to David Letterman as his retirement quickly approaches. Few and far between as they may be, there seems to have been a definite \"Golden Age\" of opera on late-night television. From the 1950s to the 80s, folks like Plácido Domingo, Marilyn Horne, Maria Callas, Leontyne Price, Richard Tucker, Martina Arroyo, and Beverly Sills made appearances on late-night shows with Johnny Carson, Ed Sullivan, and Merv Griffin. Today's late-night hosts don't chat as much with opera singers, save for Kristin Chenoweth on Conan, Renée Fleming singing for Letterman's Top 10, Josh Groban singing Kanye West tweets on Jimmy Kimmel. Oh, and [Nathan Gunn talking Papageno with Stephen Colbert](http://www.ovguide.com/tv_episode/the-colbert-report-season-4-episode-61-nathan-gunn-365962).\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZiGk5mTIHM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nWhy has late-night opera taken a nosedive? Is it because publicists for opera singers can't get them a TV spot? Are talk shows not a priority for getting a singer's name out there? Perhaps the real focus for publicicists in today's industry is on showing singers to heads of companies, rather than advertising to the general public; the former certainly helps pay the bills, while the latter is more of a big picture gesture.\n\nIt's sort of a chicken-and-egg thing, too. One one hand, you could argue that the film and television industry spent more energy making sure opera's grand history was recorded than recording it in the present day. Big stars, a connection to the Metropolitan Opera, these things do one of two things. If you were born closer to the beginning of the 20th century, opera on TV can capture part of your culture, your personal nostalgia. If you're born after 1950, and were more likely to get your culture and media from TV, seeing an opera singer sing old music in Italian almost highlights the museum-like nature of opera singing without context.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXE0DAPOfVI?list=PL5dRY_RcMeenoViJjsZzQ_K842DpI7pPP\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nTo be fair, during these decades the production of new opera had slowed and received less funding. There simply wasn't the hype or notoriety surrounding contemporary opera singers; the fame of Pavarotti and Domingo was much rarer. For TV talk shows, this would have been a decidedly poor use of air time.\n\nThink what it could do for the public's perception of opera and opera singers, to have them as a small but steady representation of the industry today. I suppose there is some gamble, for a TV network, to have a potentially \"boring\" guest on their show. I'd entrust that gamble with someone like Joyce DiDonato, who could show the non-savvy public that the people are interesting and entertaining, and most importantly, that there is a tangible point of entry into the art form for the public.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7V7kX8n3xs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nIn the meantime, if you're itching to catch some of these \"Golden Years\" interviews, Johnny Carson is where it's at. [Plácido Domingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaC3YhvaDDs) and [Marilyn Horne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f4yWsmKIVE) have both paid him a visit, as well as my personal favourite, Martina Arroyo.\n\n<figure data-type=\"video\">\n<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3bY7qMTCsU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</figure>\n\nPlus, it's hard to find for free online, but you can [purchase this huge collection, *Great Moments in Opera*](http://www.edsullivan.com/products/great-moments-in-opera/), featuring a seriously impressive list of opera stars who sang on Ed Sullivan. We're talking Maria Callas and Franco Corelli, impressive.\n\nMaybe it's a charitable, plant-tress-under-which-you'll-never-sit-type of thing to say that opera singers (and their publicists) should look to mainstream, still-popular television outlets. Maybe they won't sell a meaningful amount of tickets to a particular show, but opera singers could become less of a rare bird in the general media. Eventually, we might even evolve beyond asking questions like \"How can you sing so high?\" Well, maybe not.",

        "body": "In the first of three voice recitals in a row this week at the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, I heard mezzo-soprano [Ekaterina Gubanova](/scene/people/ekaterina-gubanova/) in recital with pianist Rachel Andrist. Rachel is a staple of the COC's music staff, working most recently on the COC's production of [*Bluebeard's Castle*](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1415Season/BluebeardErwartung.aspx). Speaking of which, Ekaterina is between performances of *Bluebeard* right now, singing Judith for the final time in Toronto this Saturday night.\n\nSince Ekaterina was completely stunning in *Bluebeard*, I was eager to hear her up close, in the well-lit Amphitheatre. The women treated us to two sets of Russian songs; *Three Songs* by Tchaikovsky preceded Modest Mussorgsky's amazing *Songs and Dances of Death*. \n\nThe Tchaikovsky were heavy (as plenty of Russian repertoire is), and Ekaterina showed off a beautifully consistent mezzo sound from top to bottom. I was impressed by her impossibly smooth transition into her chest register, which was full-bodied and clear. She really sold me on the third song, \"Wasn't I a blad of grass in the field?\" The story of a young woman, forced into an arranged marriage with an older man, was really touching; I was excited to see that Ekaterina is a lovely actress, and can tell a story without frills.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1432066551306/gubanova-ekaterina_326660_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe Mussorgsky songs were what I was most excited to hear, especially since I hadn't heard them sung by a woman. The poems are eerie, each one a conversation between Death and one of his victims. Each of the four songs are dense, complete stories, set to various dances (I love the almost gross juxtaposition of this). Ekaterina had voices and postures reserved for when she was speaking as Death, altered slightly with each victim; she (Death) sang the sad lullaby to a baby and her mother completely differently than the Death who visited fallen soldiers on the battlefield. I loved how much creepy fun Ekaterina had during the Trepak, and she boasted a cannon of a sound in the final song. She had a completely charming look of \"whoa, those songs are heavy\" after she finished, echoing the sentiments of the audience.\n\nEkaterina and Rachel returned for an operatic encore, from Rimsky-Korsakov's *The Tsar's Bride*. Almost entirely a cappella, with no translations, I was able to zero in on her really stunning sound. I love when singers can assure you that they're great at what they do, even without the transformative sets and lighting that help tell the story of *Bluebeard's Castle*. \n\nIf you haven't yet heard Ekaterina Gubanova in *Bluebeard's Castle*, you have one more chance.

        "body": "At yesterday's noon-hour concert in the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, COC Ensemble Studio member [Owen McCausland](/scene/people/owen-mccausland/) had the stage (mostly) to himself. Originally, the concert was to feature Owen along with mezzo Charlotte Burrage, splitting Janáček's cycle, *Diary of One Who Disappeared*. Instead, Owen sang a full recital, including 6 of the Janáček songs, plus selections from Ralph Vaughan Williams' *The House of Life* and Benjamin Britten's *Les illuminations*. \n\nAs COC Ensemble members graduate from the young artist programme, they're given the opportunity to sing a recital full of their own repertoire choices (a novel idea in the lives of young singers). I thought Owen's picks were fantastic, especially considering the short-notice change in the program. The Janáček is the story of a man who falls in love with a gypsy girl; we heard the first six songs, which were full of anger and guilt over the man's fixation with the girl. Owen's raw, throaty sound was beautiful for these songs; there was real wanting in his tone, sometimes crying out. I don't know this cycle well, but Owen left me eager to hear more. COC Ensemble Studio pianist Jennifer Szeto played the odd and meandering part with great purpose. I remember reading somewhere during my university years that Janáček liked to imitate speech rhythms in his instrumental music; I heard a bit of that in Szeto's playing, and it helped make sense of the songs.\n\nThe Vaughan Williams showed Owen's huge development as a recitalist. His singing in English seemed entirely different to me, creating sound on every letter of the convoluted texts of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. These songs lie low for a tenor at times, but I loved the slow build to the heroic lines in the last song, \"Love's Last Gift.\" Owen sounded totally at home. For this set and the Britten, Liz Upchurch played; she really does have a noticeably *beautiful* sound, and English song repertoire is one of her specialities. \n\nThe five songs from *Les illuminations* were a highlight for me. These songs are incredible, and the texts are complicated. Owen had such detail in the delivery of these songs; he doesn't have a Peter-Pears sound (who does, really?), but Owen reminded me of how different *Les illuminations* sounds when sung by a man. These were sexy songs, and schizophrenic; Owen took huge vocal risks, too, like in that terrifying and gorgeous line, \"et je danse,\" from \"Phrase.\" \n\nIt was so great to hear more of Owen, who has obviously stayed busy despite not being involved in the Ensemble Studio's performance of *The Barber of Seville*. There was beautiful detail in his text delivery, and his singing gets more thrilling and consistent each time I hear him.\n\nOwen earned himself an encore, for which he was joined by (almost) the entire COC Ensemble Studio, to sing Schubert's \"An die Musik\" to outgoing Free Concert Series Director of Programming, Nina Draganic. They changed the words to something more likely entitled, \"An die Nina,\" and it was too damn cute.\n\nBravo, Owen! And to the rest of the COC young artists: see you in the fall!",

        "body": "###When you've got practice time\n\nFor a pianist, learning a song or aria to perform with a singer feels like we're learning something twice. Our focus is automatically drawn to what we have to play, and it's easy to forget about all those words. Pianists (thankfully) don't have to sing well, but they do have to *really know* the text of a song. Translations, pronunciation, the rhythm and pitch inflections that come with each unique language; if you're playing a song worth singing, these elements of language inform the notes.\n\nStarting with the text can save unnecessary headaches when you start learning the notes. Singers have the sacred three-fold process: \n\n1. Speak the text until you're comfy with it.\n2. Speak the text in rhythm until it feels as natural as possible.\n3. Add the melody.\n\nIt's kind of a cool experience to go from step 1 to step 3, especially in your native language. It's really illuminating to start with an unfamiliar poem, get to know it, and then find out what a composer thought of it. Plus, with a good grasp on the words, you can get a better handle on what really happens with the music.\n\nFinally, take the breaths the singer will take. Really take them, so that you can feel how much space there will or should be; in a lot of cases, a composer will factor in a breath in their writing, so it becomes part of the musical line. You'll be able to more accurately decide on a tempo or the pacing of cadenzas.\n\n###When you know the song, but don't know the singer\n\nPianists in this situation get to become readers of minds. You have some knowledge on your side; you know the aria, you (hopefully) know the spots that everybody sings differently, and you know a reasonable tempo to set. To find out the rest, it's just about listening. \n\nThe first point of entry is the singer's breath; it can set a tempo for the piece, and establish the weight, if you will, of the voice. Language, too, is a great indicator; a good singer will sing through consonants, so in languages like Russian or German, you should have a fair amount of heads-up before the vowel you're listening for.\n\n###When you're sight-reading\n\nFor starters, be a diva. Take 30 seconds or so to yourself, so that you can have a quick but detailed look at the piece you're sight-reading. It can make a world of difference to simply have spotted tempo or key changes that come up, and find any cuts or repeats.\n\nAssuming they're sight-reading for some performance or audition, pianists know that the basic tenets of their job is to listen like crazy and stay out of the way. The best way to do this is to minimize what you're playing, so you can give more brain space to following your singer. \n\nI find Handel arias particularly treacherous to sight-read, but fortunately they often support themselves with a confident left hand and a few indicative chords in the right. In Handel and plenty of others, prioritizing the bass and soprano lines of the orchestra gives a good amount of information to the singer, and you'll not get weighed down by scales and filler.\n\n> Pianists, what have I missed?

When it comes to playing for singers, pianists are often in one of three situations:\n\n1. They have practice time to learn a song or aria.\n2. They know the song or aria, but they're playing for a new singer.\n3. They don't know the piece, and they don't know the singer.\n\nPianists have their generally great skills in sight-reading at their disposal, and the addition of a singer can easily throw a wrench in your musical plans. Here's a condensed guide to adapting your sight-reading to these three scenarios; singers notice this kind of thing, and they tend to call you back for the next gig.",

The BOP team will first take up an artist residency in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, to premiere Dean Burry's new opera, *The Bells of Baddeck*. After that, they'll tour both Nova Scotia and Ontario with *shadow box*, a cohesive collective of Canadian scenes. At last night's preview, Bicycle Opera gave us a small taste of *The Bells of Baddeck*, plus about half of *shadow box*. A quick list of the BOP team:\n\n- Larissa Koniuk, soprano\n- Stephanie Tritchew, mezzo-soprano\n- Graham Thomson, tenor\n- Alexander Dobson, baritone\n- Ilana Waniuk, violin\n- Erika Nielsen Smith, cello\n- Wesley Shen, music director and piano\n- Liza Balkan, staging\n- Sonja Rainey, projectionist & set designer\n\nThe Bike Opera crew made sure we knew who they were right off the bat, riding their bikes onstage, and playing the world premiere of Chris Thornborrow's *Ride of the Bicycle Bells*. I know what I'll be thinking of each time I get on my bike now. \n\nThe scenes were a varied slice of contemporary Canadian opera. On the program were some of my new-found favourites, like Ivan Barbotin and Liza Balkan's *(What rhymes with) Azimuth?*, and *The Blind Woman* by James Rolfe and David Yee. I loved the creepy scene, *The Yellow Wallpaper*, about a woman dealing with mental illness, who senses a ghostly presence in the wall. Bike Opera has a great sense of humour, too, which is why they indulged us with Tobin Stokes' *A five-minute bicycle opera*. The piece is a quick story of two guys with bikes, vying for the affection of a girl with a bike; more importantly, the opera is bike-pun-tastic. *shadow box* is an impressive collection, and I look forward to seeing the full version when Bike Opera comes to Toronto at the end of their Ontario tour.\n\nI was fortunate to chat with composer Dean Burry earlier in the day yesterday, and he spoke about *The Bells of Baddeck*, and achieving a balance of sophistication and accessibility with his opera, which will have its first audiences in Cape Breton. I liked the small bit I heard, which had a friendly, earthy sound to it. \n\nCongrats, Bicycle Opera, on what looks like a creative and eclectic grouping of operas, short and long. I'll be checking in with them while they're in Cape Breton this summer, so stay tuned to meet the delightful team.\n\n*21C* runs until May 24th; [click here](https://performance.rcmusic.ca/21c) to find out what's on and to purchase tickets.",

He gets a lot of bad press for being (indirectly) wrapped up with Carmen's drama, and people boycott his fights. He tries to set the record straight by testifying at Don José's trial, but ends up fending off questions from animal rights activists, set on smearing his name.\n\nThe good news? The ladies have never loved Escamillo more.\n\n###After *The Magic Flute*: Papagena\n\nAfter she's done charming the audience with her nymphomaniacal chirps and enriching the life of our favourite singing bird-catcher, Papagena has a moment to reflect. *What did I just do?* she thinks. *I was just looking for a fun way to forget about my ex, and now I've promised him at least four kids.* Everyone is telling her that Papageno is obviously the one for her because they're both sort of birds and their names are almost the same. But really, not all birds like each other, and Papageno is a pretty common name in the realm; it's like getting excited over a couple named Michael and Michelle.\n\nI see a *The Last Five Years*-type of spin-off for Papagena, maybe a one-woman-show version called *The Last Five Minutes*.\n\n###After *L'elisir d'amore*: Dulcamara\n\nRemember when Dulcamara was trying to sell Adina some of his bogus elixir so she could get Nemorino? She was playing coy, too pretty to need a love potion, and Dulcamara noticed that she was a pretty smart lady. Too smart, actually; Adina did some investigation with Nemorino about Dulcamara's product, and they ended up exposing him as a fraud. \n\nDulcamara gets arrested en route between small-town stops, and when the word gets out about the crooked wine salesman, the victims speak out in huge numbers. Tales of drunken embarrassment lovesick men and women are laid out one by one in a lengthy and probing trial. Dulcamara might be a crook, but he's a hell of a salesman; the meat of his *L'elisir* spin-off happens in prison, when he charms his way into heading an intra-prison contraband liquor market. Dulcamara discovers that selling wine to prisoners is lucrative enough, even without re-branding it as a love potion.\n\n###Before *Madama Butterfly*: Suzuki\n\nThe Suzuki story works well as a prequel, I think. \n\nSuzuki - prequel - women's suffrage pioneer in Japan? Victim of abandoned arranged marriage?",

        "description": "Based in Toronto, the Canadian Opera Company is the largest producer of opera in Canada and one of the largest in North America. The company enjoys an international reputation for artistic excellence and creative innovation.\n\nFor 40 years until April 2006, the COC had performed at the O'Keefe Centre (past names: Hummingbird Centre, The Sony Centre). Nicholas Goldschmidt and Herman Geiger-Torel founded the organization in 1950 as the Royal Conservatory Opera Company. Geiger-Torel became the COC's artistic director in 1956 and its general director in 1960. The company was renamed the Canadian Opera Association in 1960, and the Canadian Opera Company in 1977. Geiger-Torel retired from the general directorship in 1976. Lotfi Mansouri was the COC's general director from 1976 to 1988. In 1983, the COC introduced surtitles (supertitles) to their productions, the first company to use them in an opera house. Productions included Joan Sutherland's first performance of Donizetti's *Anna Bolena*.\n\nIn 1998, Bradshaw was named general director. During his tenure, Bradshaw secured funding for the COC's new permanent home, the Four Seasons Centre. The COC's first performances in the new opera house were of Wagner's *Der Ring des Nibelungen*, with designs by Michael Levine and four different directors: Michael Levine (*Das Rheingold*), Atom Egoyan (*Die Walküre*), François Girard (*Siegfried*), and Tim Albery (*Götterdämmerung*). \n\nIn June 2008, Alexander Neef was named the COC's general director, and in October 2008, Johannes Debus made his debut with COC as a conductor in a production of Prokofiev's *War and Peace*, where he earned critical acclaim.In January 2009, the COC announced the appointment of Johannes Debus as the company's music director.",

We want to take the classics and turn them sideways – that is, present them... differently. Cozily. Sometimes with beer and popcorn.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAtG's inaugural season in 2010/2011 included three critically acclaimed concert presentations and a fully staged production of<em>La Bohème</em>. We've presented sold-out concert performances of Kurt Weill's <em>The Seven Deadly Sins (and Holier Fare)</em>, a four-run production of Britten's <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> and last season's <em>Figaro's Wedding</em>, our fresh take on the Mozart classic, with a new English translation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAtG regulars have performed in very fine places – ornate halls and opera houses across this country, across the border and across the pond – and we love those audiences and that scene. But what we also love, and what we're yearning for, is intimacy. Smallness and coziness and being able to see every face in an audience.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we're doing is our very best work, but in unconventional spaces and in unconventional ways. And you're invited to see how the experiment goes, friend.\n</p>",

These four productions are supplemented by special performances, concerts, lectures and symposiums throughout the season. The company continues to attract an international audience to the scenic Cooperstown area, where the talent of singers, directors, designers and staff from around the world converges in the Alice Busch Opera Theater to produce world-class opera and music theater.\n</p>",

The first production by the new company, Madame Butterfly, was presented in May 1985 and was warmly received, thanks in part to the magnificent performance by soprano Evelyne Brunner in the title role.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWell-wishers from around the world expressed their support for the new venture, including Luciano Pavarotti, Jessye Norman, Placido Domingo, Jon Vickers, Wilhelmenia Fernandez, Pierrette Alarie and Léopold Simoneau. On the opening night, L'Opéra de Québec innovated by presenting the libretto in the form of French surtitles, the first time this had been attempted not only in Québec, but in the French-speaking world.\n</p>",

In 2013 the company broadened its mandate to include the presentation of a complete opera on a yearly basis. For its inaugural production, Opera da Camera chose Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro which was received to great public and critic success. The performance was lauded in Opera Canada and roverarts.com, among others.\n</p>",

        "description": "<p>\n\tOpera in Concert, founded by Stuart Hamilton, C.M., made its debut on October 21st 1974 with Ambroise Thomas' HAMLET at the St. Lawrence Centre's Jane Mallett Theatre. Never before heard in Canada, Thomas' treatment of the Shakespeare play was a revelation, establishing a remarkable precedent: audiences were ready for unknown repertoire that showcased young Canadian talent presented in a format that was unadorned and direct. With a single stroke the Opera in Concert vision of rarely heard works sung by remarkable artists attained validity with opera professionals and the opera loving public. Soon enough, Opera in Concert expanded to as many as four operas per season with a full sized Choral component under Robert Cooper, C.M., an orchestra component for each season and THE BACKGROUNDER with Iain Scott.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSince 1974, Opera in Concert has achieved an amazing record of more than 158 operas, 90 of which have been Canadian Premieres, stylistically ranging from Vivaldi's LA GRISELDA through Schmidt's NOTRE DAME to the modern sonorities of Harry Somers' THE FOOL. The company promoted the careers of Isabel Bayrakdarian, Ben Heppner, Aline Kutan, John Relyea, Richard Margison, Russell Braun, Frederique Vezina, Allyson McHardy, Michael Schade, Josh Hopkins, Jean Stilwell, Colin Ainsworth, John Mac Master and Rosemarie Landry, just to name a few and to this day, continues its commitment to nurture and foster the advancement of young artists.\n</p>",

In addition to producing a concert and chamber opera season, Tapestry has become an international crossroads for diverse musical and dramatic artists inspired to contribute to the creation and evolution of new opera. Creation begins with multiple collaborations at the Composer-Librettist Laboratory (LibLab), where eight writers and composers are introduced and produce sixteen opera shorts under intense conditions. Successful partnerships may result in commissioning new full length works by Tapestry or by other producers. Evolution exists not only in the content and style of the music and text but also in performance practice. Tapestry Explorations (Tap:Ex) is Canada's premiere program for the evolution and advancement of opera performance practice and seeks inspiration from other art forms in both art and popular streams.\n</p>",

        "description": "The Vienna State Opera (German: Wiener Staatsoper) is an opera house – and opera company – with a history dating back to the mid-19th century. It is located in the centre of Vienna, Austria. It was originally called the Vienna Court Opera (Wiener Hofoper). In 1920, with the replacement of the Habsburg Monarchy by the First Republic of Austria, it was renamed the Vienna State Opera. The members of the Vienna Philharmonic are recruited from its orchestra.\n\nThe Vienna State Opera is closely linked to the Vienna Philharmonic, which is an incorporated society of its own, but whose members are recruited from the orchestra of the Vienna State Opera.\n\nThe Wiener Staatsoper is one of the busiest opera houses in the world producing 50 to 60 operas per year and ten ballet productions in approximately 300 performances. It is quite common to find a different opera being produced each day of a week. As such, the Staatsoper employs over 1000 people. As of 2008, the annual operating budget of the Staatsoper was 100 million Euros with slightly more than 50% coming in the form of a state subsidy.\n\nThe opera company operates a repertory system: more than 50 productions are staged every year, and there is a performance nearly every day for ten months of the year.\n\nThe opera's current musical director is Franz Welser-Möst.",

        "description": "<p>\n\tIn the world of opera, Glyndebourne is unique. It is recognised globally as one of the great opera houses. Its productions travel worldwide, are performed live in other opera houses and screened in cinemas from New York to Tokyo.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYet it remains a very English institution. The opera house stands next to the country home of John Christie, who founded it in 1934. Now run by his grandson Gus, it is still very much a family concern. Its Festival audiences arrive from far and wide and an extended interval gives them time for an evening meal. Many choose to picnic in the garden. Some sprawl on rugs, others bring tables, candlesticks and ice buckets. Almost all wear evening dress.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSuch eccentricities are part of Glyndebourne's charm. But its global reputation stems from a passion for artistic excellence. Founder John Christie insisted on \"doing not the best we can do but the best that can be done anywhere\". For over 80 years, that has remained Glyndebourne's touchstone.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGlyndebourne's commitment to quality has earned it a loyal following, enabling it to preserve its financial independence through good times and bad. Its reputation enables it to attract the world's finest artists. Today, its Festival and Tour present over 120 performances each year, to some 150,000 people. It's an institution, but not a museum. Glyndebourne (and its audiences) are noted for their sense of adventure. Its programmes balance well-known repertoire with less familiar works, both old and new, including British premières and new commissions. In addition to established opera directors, Glyndebourne invites talented theatre directors to bring their creative vision to opera, often for the first time.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Glyndebourne has always looked to the future, developing new talent, new works and new audiences. Artists whose careers started here include Kate Royal, Thomas Allen, Edward Gardner, Joan Sutherland, Janet Baker, John Tomlinson, Simon Rattle and John Pritchard.\n</p>",

This makes the programme of the Bayerische Staatsoper one of the most richly varied performance schedules of all the international opera houses. With 2,101 seats, the Bayerische Staatsoper's principal performance venue, the National Theatre – built in classicistic style in 1818 – is the largest opera house in Germany and ranks as one of the handsomest theatres in Europe. Tours of the National Theatre take place almost every day.\n</p>",

Under the leadership of Founding General Director Peter Hemmings and subsequently under Plácido Domingo, LA Opera has grown to become a company of international stature. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tLA Opera has taken several significant steps in recent years to nurture its tradition of artistic excellence. Plácido Domingo served as the Company's Artistic Consultant from 1984 until October 1998, when Mr. Domingo was named Artistic Director Designate. The 2001/02 season marked Mr. Domingo's first fully planned season with the Company as Artistic Director and included eight Company premieres. In May 2003, Mr. Domingo was named General Director of LA Opera. In September 2006, in honor of a $6 million gift from Eli and Edythe L. Broad as lead sponsors of the Company's first <em>Ring</em> cycle, his title became The Eli and Edythe Broad General Director. In addition, Mr. Domingo has sung more than 130 performances and has also conducted well over 70 performances of both operas and concert works with the Company. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tKent Nagano joined LA Opera as Principal Conductor in the 2001/02 season, and in May 2003, he was named LA Opera's first ever Music Director. In 2006, James Conlon succeeded Maestro Nagano and currently holds the position of Richard Seaver Music Director. Mr. Conlon's dynamic leadership has brought new international acclaim for the Company, and his important new artistic initiatives have included an emphasis on the works of Richard Wagner, the ongoing<em>Recovered Voices</em> series dedicated to performing the unjustly neglected operas of composers who were affected by the Holocaust, a three-season celebration of the centenary of Benjamin Britten, and an ongoing collaboration with the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels to bring together professional and amateur musicians from every part of Los Angeles in performances of family operas. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tThroughout its history, the Company has maintained a talented roster of Resident Artists, young singers who perform regularly in mainstage productions as well as the Company's community programs. The program prepares young artists who have the potential for major careers in opera by providing invaluable experience and training. Among the distinguished artists who have gone on to enjoy national and international success are Rod Gilfry and Paula Rasmussen. Beginning with the 2006/07 season, the Domingo-Thornton Young Artist Program was inaugurated, with its own separate staff under the personal supervision of Plácido Domingo. The program is designed so that participants can work full-time on developing their careers during that critical stage between the end of their formal academic or conservatory training and the onset of professional performing careers. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tLA Opera traces its roots back to 1948, when a company called the Los Angeles Civic Grand Opera presented a performance of <em>Rigoletto</em> in a church hall in Beverly Hills. The Company, under the directorship of Francesco Pace, staged productions through the 1950s, and in 1964 it presented the first opera performed in the Music Center's brand-new Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Shortly after its third production at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, <em>L'Italiana in Algeri</em> starring Marilyn Horne, the Los Angeles Civic Grand Opera abandoned its own production projects and recreated itself as the Music Center Opera Association. For two decades, the Association brought opera from other cities to the Music Center. By far the lengthiest arrangement was with New York City Opera, which brought productions to the Music Center every fall from 1966 to 1982. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tIn 1984, the Music Center Opera Association hired Peter Hemmings as its Founding General Director and gave him the task of creating a new opera company that would once again present its own productions in Los Angeles. It was through this important turn of events that LA Opera was born. Mr. Hemmings stepped down as LA Opera's General Director in 2000, and the following season Plácido Domingo assumed leadership of the Company.\n</p>",

It takes its inspiration from the rich courtly masque tradition of the late Renaissance and explores the limitless possibilities of the art form. The company offers intimate productions which fuse aspects from different performing arts, primarily music, dance and theatre, and has a reputation for warmth, originality and excellence.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA significant player on the Toronto arts scene, the company has produced 40 critically acclaimed productions, ranging in repertoire from the late Renaissance to new works that reinvent this historic performing art form and speak to multi-cultural Toronto in the 21st century.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTMT has commissioned eight new works: three from James Rolfe, and one each from Omar Daniel, Abigail Richardson, Dean Burry, Alice Ping Yee Ho and Juliet Palmer. Librettists have included André Alexis, Marjorie Chan, Steven Heigton and Anna Chatterton. The company has also presented music theatre works by Monteverdi, Purcell, Handel, John Blow, Stravinsky and John Beckwith, plays by Edna St. Vincent Millay, James Reaney, Patrick Garland and Molière, and \"variety\" evenings such as <em>Les roses de la vie, Commedia and Masque of Irony.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding New Musical/Opera was awarded to TMT's 2013 commission, <em>The Lesson of Da Ji</em> by Toronto composer Alice Ping Yee Ho and librettist Marjorie Chan. TMT has appeared at the Guelph Spring Festival, the Festival of the Sound, the Westben Festival, the Music and Beyond Festival in Ottawa and the Elora Festival, and has been heard on CBC Radio.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBeckwith is supported in this work by co-artistic associates, Derek Boyes and Marie-Nathalie Lacoursière, the company's managing director, Vivian Moens, and an active and enthusiastic board of Directors.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTMT has set itself the goals of: introducing audiences of all ages to the art of the masque; increasing our audience's understanding and appreciation of the masque tradition through both performances and an active education and outreach program; achieving consistent excellence of performance standards in music, theatre and dance, with an historically informed sensibility; involving and engaging the audience; and exploring and expanding the repertoire of the art form by reviving little-known works, creating innovative programs, and commissioning and performing new works.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe company presents an annual subscription series consisting of between two and four productions, each presented over two to four evenings. In 2013 we introduced a Salon series, and we have an active educational outreach tradition.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it goes into its eleventh season, TMT is as committed as ever to exploring the special world created by the melding of music, theatre and dance, past and present.\n</p>",

        "description": "<p>\n\tFounded in 1956 as a modest but intrepid ensemble known as the Opera Society of Washington,Washington National Opera (WNO) is today one of America's largest opera companies. WNO draws inspiration from a rich legacy built on the values of artistic excellence, engagement with a broad community, and a thriving future for the art form of opera and its audiences. As an affiliate of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, WNO performs fall and spring seasons in the 2,200-seat Kennedy Center Opera House. WNO also offers performances on Millennium Stage and at other venues at the Center and throughout the city, and offers training, educational, and enrichment programs year-round.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWNO's artistic profile is marked by numerous highlights, including 25 world and American premieres and over 60 new productions. With a commitment to presenting dramatically compelling works executed at the highest levels of artistry, the company balances the standard repertory with new and infrequently performed works. Some of opera's most renowned artists have collaborated with WNO, including Gian Carlo Menotti, Franco Zeffirelli, Eva Marton, and Igor Stravinsky in the company's early years, and more recently, José Carreras, former General Director Plácido Domingo, Renée Fleming, Juan Diego Flórez and Anna Netrebko, among many others.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the past decade, the company has stepped into the international spotlight with ambitious projects such as a company-wide tour to Japan in 2002; international broadcasts; the acclaimed \"American Ring\" cycle; and the inauguration of wide-reaching education, training, and community enrichment programs.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSince its inception, WNO has actively fostered the careers of promising young artists, and many major artists appeared with the company early in their careers. WNO's commitment to young talent was formalized in 2001, when Plácido Domingo founded WNO's Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program, which today stands as one of the premier training residencies for artists on the verge of international careers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond the Opera House, WNO engages a broad public.Free and low-cost audience development programs such as Artist Q&amp;As, lectures, master classes, Generation O (a discount ticket program for 18-35 year olds), and partnerships with other local cultural organizations ensure that WNO performances are accessible to all. The company was among the first to simulcast its productions, bringing free opera broadcasts to tens of thousands in an annual program known as Opera in the Outfield at Nationals ballpark. Coupled with award-winning youth education programs serving public schools in the District, Maryland, and Virginia, WNO's programs are a vital resource not only for opera lovers, but for students and arts educators throughout the metro region. WNO productions have been heard nationally and internationally through radio and television broadcasts on NPR, XM Satellite Radio, and PBS, as well as through commercial audio and video recordings.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the hundreds of artists who appear with WNO each season, company members include the Washington National Opera Orchestra and Chorus; singers and coach/accompanists of the Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program; and a corps of dedicated supernumeraries. Prior to onstage rehearsals and performances, these artists work at the WNO Studio at Takoma, which also houses WNO's Costume Studio. Artistic and administrative leadership includes Francesca Zambello, Artistic Director; Philippe Auguin, Music Director; and Michael Mael, Executive Director. They carry on a legacy established by the company's founders and fostered by leaders such as former General Directors Martin Feinstein and Plácido Domingo.\n</p>",

        "description": "<p>\n\tManitoba Opera was established in 1969 by Founding President Justice Kerr Twaddle and a group of individuals dedicated to presenting the great works of opera to Manitoban audiences.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the early 70's to 1998, Dr. Irving Guttman C.M. served as Manitoba Opera's Artistic Director. During this time, MO established a reputation for the discovery and development of young artists and for stellar casting. <em>\"Excellent casting, a company hallmark since the time of ... Irving Guttman, reached new heights in the Mascagni.\" (Opera Canada, fall issue 2004). \"Boasting a talented cast\" (Elixir of Love, Winnipeg Free Press 2005), \"fine-tuned and well-matched cast\" (La Boheme, Opera Canada 2005) \"The cast is marvellous</em>\" <em>(Die Fledermaus, Winnipeg Free Press, 2006)</em> \"<em>They have set the performance bar -- and they set it impressively high\" (Transit of Venus, Winnipeg Free Press, 2007)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe company has helped to cultivate artists such as Judith Forst, Tracy Dahl, Richard Margison, Phillip Ens, Jean Stilwell, Sally Dibblee, Michael Cavanagh, and now a new generation of artists like Nikki Einfeld, Monica Huisman, and Gregory Dahl, and directors Rob Herriot and Ann Hodges. In the 1990's, Manitoba Opera programmed a recital series which saw international opera artists appear in concert with the company. Artists such as Kiri Te Kanawa, Kathleen Battle, Samuel Ramey, Jerry Hadley, and Frederica Von Stade all performed recitals for MO in a program call the Orpheus series. In the 1980's, singers such as Leona Mitchell, Dolora Zajick, Maria Pellegrini, Ermanno Mauro, Jan Rubes, Maureen Forrester, all appeared in productions with Manitoba Opera.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tManitoba Opera has embraced all aspects of its mandate throughout its history, producing a range of repertoire as well as producing new Canadian works. In 1972, Manitoba Opera presented a concert version of Verdi's <em>Il Trovatore </em>for its first production. In the 1995/96 season, MO staged the only full-scale production of Randolph Peters' <em>Nosferatu</em>. Now in its 42nd season of operations, Manitoba Opera produces two full-scale productions annually in the 2,200 seat Manitoba Centennial Concert Hall for a total of 6 performances and 2 student dress rehearsal performances. In 2007-08, we presented our first full-length commission - the world premiere of <em>Transit of Venus</em> by Victor Davies and Maureen Hunter.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Manitoba Opera is supported, not only by individual and corporate donors, but also by The Canada Council, The Manitoba Arts Council, The City of Winnipeg and foundations such as The Winnipeg Foundation and The Thomas Sill Foundation.\n</p>",

        "description": "<p>\n\tOpera Theatre of Saint Louis is one of the leading American opera companies, known for a spring festival of inventive new productions, sung in English, featuring the finest American singers and accompanied by members of the St. Louis Symphony. With the launch of the 2014 season, Opera Theatre has presented 24 world premieres and 23 American premieres – which may be the highest percentage of new work in the repertory of any U.S. company. Described by The Sunday Times of London as \"one of the few American companies worth the transatlantic fare,\" Opera Theatre of Saint Louis annually welcomes visitors from nearly every state and close to a dozen foreign countries. Although the size of the theater typically limits box office income to less than a quarter of the budget, the company has consistently produced work of the highest quality while never accumulating a deficit.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOpera Theatre also has a long tradition of discovering and promoting the careers of the finest operatic artists of the current generation. Among the artists who had important early opportunities at Opera Theatre are Christine Brewer, Susan Graham, Nathan Gunn, Patricia Racette, Thomas Hampson, Jerry Hadley, Dawn Upshaw, Sylvia McNair, Erie Mills, Dwayne Croft, Kelly Kaduce, Lawrence Brownlee, Jamie Barton, Corinne Winters, Anthony Dean Griffey, and Christine Goerke. Opera Theatre has always been known for distinguished leadership: founding general director Richard Gaddes was succeeded in 1985 by general director Charles MacKay, with famed British stage director Colin Graham as artistic director and Stephen Lord (1992 – present) as music director. Timothy O'Leary was named general director in October 2008 with acclaimed stage director James Robinson succeeding Colin Graham\n</p>",

It is also known as Deutsche Staatsoper, and short as Lindenoper. From 1949 to 1990 it was the state opera of East Germany. Since 2004 the Berlin State Opera belongs like the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Komische Oper Berlin, the Berlin State Ballet and the Bühnenservice Berlin (Stage and Costume Design) to the Berlin Opera Foundation.\n\nSince 2009, the Berlin State Opera has been undergoing considerable renovation work led by German architect HG Merz. The roof of the opera building was raised and the proscenium prolonged to improve the acoustics. Other renovation and extension works include the director's building, the below-ground connection building and the depot building. The latter will house the new rehearsal center.",

        "description": "Talisker Players is a unique ensemble of instrumentalists dedicated to collaborating with singers. We present one of the most interesting and innovative annual concert series in Toronto, and we also perform throughout southern Ontario and across the country. We are Musicians in Residence at Massey College, University of Toronto.\n\nThe history of the ensemble revolves around our passion for the particular rewards and challenges of vocal/instrumental collaboration. We began in 1995 as a flexible-sized orchestra dedicated to accompanying choirs, and we continue to work with dozens of choirs throughout southern Ontario. The Choral Music Orchestra is a favourite with choirs and audiences alike, and has earned a well-deserved reputation for excellence. For more information, click here.\n\nTalisker Players Chamber Music evolved from the original choral music orchestra. This adventurous concert series transfers our skills in vocal/instrumental collaboration to the more intimate realm of chamber music. Core players from the choral music orchestra, in varying combinations, are joined by some of Canada’s most exciting singers to explore this compelling repertoire, in which instrumental colours and sonorities interact with words in endlessly fascinating ways.\n\nWe have been widely praised for our unusual programming, and our polished and distinctive presentation. Our productions are thematic, and each includes the spoken word as well as the music. Poetry, memoirs, letters, essays, read by professional actors, are woven into the programme to elaborate on the theme and give a dramatic narrative to the production.\n\nMemorable past programmes have included: Reflections of Eden, an exploration the natural world and of our place in it; Sense and Nonsense, an off-centre look at the world through nonsense poetry and surrealist stories; Ellis Portal, a journey through the urban landscape of Toronto after dark; The Harp of Fire, a celebration of the wisdom and the passion of the great Indian poet and musician Rabindranath Tagore; and many more (see Archives link).\n\nAlthough we perform music from all periods, we have a strong commitment to the music of living composers. We have commissioned at least one new work in every season, and often more. The Fenian Cycle, which we commissioned from Toronto composer Craig Galbraith, won the Karen Kieser Prize for 2004.\n\nWe have also presented recent works from numerous young and emerging composers; and we have revived wonderful works by Canadian composers from earlier generations, such as Harry Somers, Harry Freedman, Malcolm Forsyth, Jean Coulthard, Violet Archer, and Sir Ernest MacMillan. And we’ve performed works by international composers like Lukas Foss, George Crumb, Osvaldo Golijov, John Harbison, Ernst Toch, Karl Heinz Füssl, Luciano Berio, Morton Feldman, Rebecca Clarke and Ivor Gurney – many of which were Canadian premieres.\n\nOur Main Series concerts take place in the excellent acoustics and warm atmosphere of Trinity St. Paul’s Centre for the Arts, one of Toronto’s premier chamber concert locations, at 427 Bloor Street West, just west of Spadina.\n\nOur Outreach programmes focus on the neighbourhood of Regent Park, one of the most challenged areas of the inner city. These programmes take our music out into homeless shelters and drop-in centres, to audiences almost entirely neglected by most arts groups. For more information, click here.\n\nOur residency at Massey College, University of Toronto, includes performances on special occasions throughout the academic year. We are also available as mentors and coaches for members of the College.\n\nTalisker Players Chamber Music is a registered charity governed by a Board of Directors. In addition to ticket sales, the organization's activities are funded by tax deductible gifts from individuals and corporations, and by grants from foundations and government agencies.",

        "description": "Opera After Hours is a new Canadian opera company that presents historical opera in unusual ways.  Our mission is to create and present performances that build bridges between the baroque and the contemporary; the artist and the audience; the imaginary and the real. We value innovation, risk taking, flexibility, artistic intuition, interdisciplinary collaboration, experimentation and artistic excellence.\n \nOAH was founded by Canadian keyboardist, Christopher Bagan, and Canadian mezzo soprano, Debi Wong. Our inaugural production, #DidoAndAeneas, will be presented from June 5 - 7, 2014, in Vancouver, BC.\n \n###Artistic Directors\n\n**Christopher Bagan** is a versatile artist, equally at home on modern and historical keyboard instruments. He is in high demand as a collaborator, chamber musician and basso continuo specialist. Recent engagements include appearances with soprano Ellen Hargis, Toronto Masque Theatre, Aradia Ensemble, University of Toronto Opera and the Britten-Pears Baroque Orchestra as well as his debut as music director for Handel's Giulio Cesare in Ferreira do Zezere, Portugal. He holds a Doctor of Musical Arts from the University of British Columbia where he studied with Jane Coop. He is a regular performer in the Early Music Vancouver main series and Summer Festival as well as Vancouver’s Music on Main concert series. He has performed with many of the leading baroque singers, instrumentalists and conductors in North America. He now resides in Toronto where he is on faculty at the University of Toronto and at St. Michael’s Choir School, and is a staff accompanist at the Glenn Gould School. He also freelances across Canada, working as a soloist, chamber musician, lecturer and collaborative keyboardist.\n\nPraised for her \"effective performances\" and \"rich tone\" (The Vancouver Sun), Canadian mezzo-soprano, **Debi Wong**, is fast establishing herself as a dynamic and unique performer.  Previous performances highlights include: role of the “Sorceress” in the Britten-Pears production of Dido and Aeneas directed by Christian Curnyn, Love and Death in Venice with Alexander Weimann and Montreal’s Les Voix Baroque, and the role of Venere in Monteverdi’s Il Ballo delle Ingrate with Stephen Stubbs and the Early Music Guild of Seattle.\n\nDebi also performs regularly with, White Sparrow, a lute and voice duo based in Helsinki Finland. White Sparrow was awarded first place in the NORDEM Ear-ly competition for new ensembles in the Nordic countries. It was featured on the Canadian Broadcasting Company’s radio show North by Northwest and was one of only six ensembles selected to appear at the International Young Artist Presentation at the Laus Polyphinae Festival in Antwerp, Belgium. \n\nDebi holds a Master's of music from the Yale Institute of Sacred Music and she is currently purusing a Doctor of Music at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, Finland.\n ",

Centred in the power of the human voice, Urbanvessel‘s creative works aim to alter our audience’s perspective on their world.\n\nUrbanvessel creates new performance works through interdisciplinary collaboration. Rooted in music and sound, the power of the human voice is at the heart of our creative process. Led by Artistic Director  Juliet Palmer and drawing upon the diverse talents of our collaborators, Urbanvessel fuses sound, music, text, imagery and movement. Urbanvessel shares knowledge through our educational programmes and community outreach activities.\n\nUrbanvessel‘s works are inspired by disparate impulses: from sound, politics, fetishes, history and ritual, to poverty, architecture, music and sports. Our creative response to the source material is filtered through an inclusive feminist perspective. A new interdisciplinary team is formed for each project, organized horizontally so that artistic decisions are made collaboratively. Our methodology combines improvisation and composition in tandem with an inclusive process for critical feedback and revision.\n\nUrbanvessel was founded in 2006 by Palmer and architect Christie Pearson. Works include: VOICE-BOX (Harbourfront World Stage 2010, Fresh Ground New Work commission); STITCH (Freefall Festival/World Stage 2008); SLIP for the Harrison Baths (X Avant Festival, Toronto 2006); SLIP (2008 BRAVO Fact! film); and THE PROVINCE OF IMPOSSIBLE (Voice++ Festival, Open Space Arts, Victoria 2007; Sound Symposium 2008; Ottawa Chamber Music Festival).\n\nUrbanvessel Performing Arts Inc. is an Incorporated Non-Profit Organization.\n\nBoard of Directors: Micheline Roi, Elizabeth Rucker and Keith McNair\n\nArtistic Advisor: Christie Pearson",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tAn enthusiastic, coffee-loving baritone hailing from 100 Mile House, BC, Aaron Durand began singing lessons at the age of nine, but knew nothing of opera until a chance viewing of <em>Carmen</em> in Vancouver at age 16. Consumed by the wonderful music, Aaron tackled a bachelor's degree in music followed by a master's degree, both at UBC, where he performed as part of the celebrated UBC Opera Ensemble across Canada, China and eastern Europe.

        "biography": "<p>\n\tHailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as \"a beautiful woman who commands the stage\" and \"a major soprano,\" Ailyn Pérez is increasingly in demand at the world's leading opera houses and cultural capitals. She has won both the 15th annual Plácido Domingo Award and the 2012 Richard Tucker Award, thereby becoming the only Hispanic recipient in the award's 35-year history. As <i>Opera News</i> observes, \"The phrase 'an embarrassment of riches' might have been invented to describe the combination of talents that belong to Ailyn Pérez…who truly seems to have it all.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter singing Zerlina in Mozart's <i>Don Giovanni</i> with James Conlon and the Chicago Symphony at this summer's Ravinia Festival, Pérez looks forward to making her house and role debuts next season as Desdemona in Verdi's <i>Otello</i> at Houston Grand Opera and as Micaëla in Bizet's <i>Carmen</i> at the Metropolitan Opera. Besides headlining a new production of <i>La traviata</i> at Zurich Opera, in 2014-15 she will also sing Mimì in <i>La bohème</i> at Hamburg State Opera, and portray a pair of Donizetti heroines – Adina in <i>L'elisir d'amore</i> and Norina in <i>Don Pasquale</i> – at the Bavarian State Opera and Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu, respectively. In concert, the soprano will join her husband and frequent co-star, tenor Stephen Costello, for programs of operatic duets at Washington National Opera, Dallas Opera, and Opera Philadelphia, where they launch the company's 40th Anniversary Season with a special gala performance in the city where they first fell in love.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAlready something of a calling card for Pérez, the role of Violetta in <i>La traviata</i> was the vehicle for five of her operatic engagements in 2013-14. She launched the new season at the Hamburg State Opera, opposite Costello, before revisiting Verdi's doomed heroine at Spain's Ópera de Oviedo and the Bavarian State Opera. Pérez and Costello reunited in those roles at San Francisco Opera and London's Royal Opera House, where Pérez had already been hailed as \"an ideal Violetta\" (<i>Observer</i>, UK). She returned to Covent Garden to undertake the title part of Massenet's <i>Manon</i> in Laurent Pelly's celebrated treatment, and to make her role debut as Liù in Puccini's<i>Turandot</i>, before closing the opera season as she began it, opposite Costello in Verdi at Hamburg State Opera, this time as Gilda to his Duke in <i>Rigoletto</i>. She made her U.S. solo recital debut at Philadelphia's Kimmel Center, and graced a \"dream team of opera singers\" (<i>New York Times</i>) at the Richard Tucker Music Foundation gala at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall. Dubbed \"America's fastest-rising husband-and-wife opera stars\" (Associated Press) and praised for their \"palpable chemistry\"(<i>New York Times</i>), Pérez and Costello teamed up for operatic duets at the \"Classic FM Live\" gala at London's Royal Albert Hall, and released their Warner Classics album debut,<i>Love Duets</i>, which was recorded with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Patrick Summers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHigh points of the 2012-13 season included house debuts at the Bolshoi Opera and Glyndebourne where, as<i>Falstaff</i>'s Alice Ford, \"Pérez's golden voice soared lyrically…[and] she commanded the stage with ease\" (<i>Opera Today</i>). The Richard Tucker Foundation Gala honored the soprano as winner of the 2012 Richard Tucker Award, and her album debut – <i>Poème d'un jour</i>, a program of French and Italian songs on the Opus Arte label – was released to rave reviews. The UK's <i>Independent</i> awarded it a full five stars, while <i>International Record Review</i>confessed: \"Every so often, a singer comes along who completely bowls you over.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe soprano's previous career highlights include headlining <i>La traviata</i> and <i>Manon</i> on a Japanese tour with the Royal Opera, when the UK's <i>Guardian</i> pronounced her performance \"an unalloyed triumph,\" and appearances at Los Angeles Opera, Dallas Opera, Cincinnati Opera, San Diego Opera, Florida Grand Opera, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Michigan Opera Theater, Opera Company of Philadelphia, Covent Garden, Milan's Teatro alla Scala, Berlin's Staatsoper Unter den Linden, Hamburg State Opera, Zurich Opera, Valencia's Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía, and Chile's Teatro Municipal de Santiago. Besides those already mentioned, her notable roles include the title character in Gounod's <i>Roméo et Juliette</i>, Marguerite in <i>Faust</i>, Amelia Grimaldi in <i>Simon Boccanegra</i>, Pamina in <i>Die Zauberflöte</i>, Leïla in <i>Les pêcheurs de perles</i>, Lauretta in <i>Gianni Schicchi</i>, Marzelline in <i>Fidelio</i>, Suzel in<i>L'amico Fritz</i>, Anne Trulove in <i>The Rake's Progress,</i> and the four heroines in <i>Les contes d'Hoffmann</i>. Pérez has performed at London's Rosenblatt Recitals and Berlin's German AIDS Foundation; has taken part in Schubert's<i>Mass in C</i>, Mozart and Verdi's Requiems, and Mahler's Second Symphony; and has appeared in concert with José Carreras, Andrea Bocelli, and Plácido Domingo, opposite whom she sang in gala concerts at the Royal Opera House and headlined a concert performance of <i>La bohème</i> at the Salzburg Festival.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAilyn Pérez is a graduate of Philadelphia's Academy of Vocal Arts and Indiana University. She is a recipient of the George London Foundation's Leonie Rysanek Award, a 2007 winner of a Shoshana Foundation Career Grant, placed second in the 2006 Plácido Domingo <i>Operalia </i>Competition, and has been honored by the Loren L. Zachary Foundation, Opera Index, and the Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation.\n</p>",

Her works have become part of the standard repertoire, in particular her many compositions for piano which are frequently performed by students and professionals alike. Perhaps best known of these is <em>Scenes From A Jade Terrace</em>, commissioned by Jon Kimura Parker, who recently celebrated the 20th Anniversary of its composition with a tour of Canada and the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Louie's orchestral works have received important performances by such renowned<br>\n\tconductors as Sir Andrew Davis, Leonard Slatkin, Alexander Lazarev, Charles Dutoit,<br>\n\tBramwell Tovey, Gunther Herbig, Pinchas Zukerman, Kent Nagano, Peter Oundjian,<br>\n\tCarlos Kalmar, James Judd, and Ingo Metzmacher.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHer major theatrical works include <em>The Scarlet Princess</em>, a full-length opera with libretto by Tony Award-winning playwright David Henry Hwang (<em>M.

Amanda's interest in the intersection of classical music with other art forms has led her to interesting collaborations with visual artists, dancers, filmmakers, writers and electronic music producers. Her goal is to explore the potential of classical music and show new audiences how classical music and opera are equivalent to the many, more readily accepted art forms that younger generations patron today.\n</p>",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tSerbian-born composer Ana Sokolović, who has lived in Montreal for two decades, has been immersed in the arts all her life. Before taking up theatre and music, she studied classical ballet. She studied composition at university under Dusan Radić in Novi Sad and Zoran Erić in Belgrade, then completed a master's degree under the supervision of José Evangelista at the Université de Montréal in the mid-1990s. Her work is suffused with her fascination for different forms of artistic expression. Both rich and playful, her compositions draw the listener into a vividly imagined world, often inspired by Balkan folk music and its asymmetrical festive rhythms. The winds of change brought by her work quickly vaulted her to a prominent position on the Quebec, Canadian and international contemporary music scenes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOver the years, Ana Sokolović has earned a steady stream of commissions and awards. Today, her repertoire includes orchestral, vocal, chamber, operatic and theatrical pieces. From 1995 to 1998, she was a three-time recipient of the SOCAN Foundation Award for Young Composers. In the 1999 edition of the CBC Young Composers Competition, she won the grand prize along with first prize in the chamber music category. In 2005, she won the Joseph S. Stauffer Prize presented by the Canada Council for the Arts, and in 2007 the Conseil québécois de la musique awarded her the Prix Opus for composer of the year. In 2008, she won the Jan V. Matejcek Award presented by SOCAN; in 2012, she was a repeat winner of the same award. In 2009, she won the prestigious National Arts Centre Award, which included commissions, residencies and teaching positions over a five-year period. In the summer of 2012, her opera Svadba-Wedding, commissioned and produced by the Queen of Puddings Music Theatre, received six nominations for the Dora Mavor Moore Awards and won for Outstanding New Musical/Opera. The opera then went on tour in Canada and Europe until 2015.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Société de musique contemporaine du Québec (SMCQ) recently marked the 20th anniversary of Ana Sokolović's arrival in Quebec with a celebration of her body of work. \"For the scope, diversity and quality of her work; for the originality of her approach; for her energy, her reputation among the most prestigious institutions and her appeal to audiences of all ages,\"* the society's artistic committee unanimously decided to devote the third edition of its Série Hommage tribute performance series to her. The series, held over the 2011-12 season, attracted record participation as Canadian artists and organizations enthusiastically answered the call. More than 200 events were presented in her honour from coast to coast.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAna Sokolović just received a prestigious commission from the Canadian Opera Company for a main-stage opera that will be premiered during the 2019/20 season. The libretto <em>La Reine-Garçon</em>, originally written as a theatre play by one of the most important and talented Quebec play writers Michel Marc Bouchard, will be adapted by the author.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAna Sokolović teaches composition at the Université de Montréal.\n</p>",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tAnna Netrebko has redefined what it means to be an opera star and in the process she has become one of the most acclaimed and widely-recognized classical singers in the world today. Regularly headlining productions at virtually every leading opera house across the globe, the Russian soprano has been hailed by the <em>Associated Press</em> as \"the reigning new diva of the early 21st century.\" In 2007 she became the first classical musician to be selected as one of the <em>Time </em>100, <em>Time</em> magazine's list of the most influential people in the world. Her beautiful, dark, distinctive voice and her elegant and alluring stage presence have prompted critics to describe her as \"Audrey Hepburn with a voice\" and \"a singer who simply has it all: a voice of astounding purity, precision, and scope, extensive dynamic and tonal range, imagination, insight, and wit—all combined with a dazzling charisma that makes it all but impossible to look away when she is performing\" (<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>).\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSince her triumphant Salzburg Festival debut in 2002 as Donna Anna in Mozart's<em>Don Giovanni</em>, Netrebko has gone on to appear with nearly all the world's great opera companies, including the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, London's Royal Opera House, Milan's Teatro alla Scala, Vienna State Opera, Paris Opera, Zurich Opera, Berlin State Opera, and Munich's Bavarian State Opera. She frequently returns to the Kirov Opera at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg (where she made her stage debut as Susanna in Mozart's <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>) to collaborate with her longtime mentor, conductor Valery Gergiev. As well as Mozart's Susanna, Netrebko's other signature roles past and present include Puccini's Mimì (<em>La bohème</em>) and Manon Lescaut; Verdi's Violetta (<em>La traviata</em>), Lady Macbeth (<em>Macbeth</em>) and Giovanna d'Arco; Bellini's Giulietta (<em>I Capuleti e i Montecchi</em>), Elvira (<em>I puritani</em>), and Amina (<em>La sonnambula</em>); Mozart's Donna Anna (<em>Don Giovanni</em>); Donizetti's Norina (<em>Don Pasquale</em>), Adina (<em>L'elisir d'amore</em>), Lucia (<em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>), and Anna Bolena; the title role in Massenet's <em>Manon</em>; Juliette in Gounod's<em> Roméo et Juliette</em>; and Tchaikovsky's Tatiana (<em>Eugene Onegin</em>) and Iolanta.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNetrebko also appears extensively in concerts throughout the world, both in famous music venues such as New York's Carnegie Hall and in arenas in front of tens of thousands of people. Her outdoor concerts – in which she has shared the stage with artists such as Plácido Domingo and Dmitri Hvorostovsky at places ranging from Berlin's Waldbühne to Moscow's Red Square – are often internationally televised events. She is a fixture at the Salzburg Festival and has headlined the famous Last Night of the Proms in London. Netrebko frequently appears in recital with the world's leading artists, including Daniel Barenboim.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing a season that saw the soprano venture into bold new repertoire with the release of her <em>Verdi</em> recording, she continues to broaden her horizons over the coming year. This season, she makes her American role debut as Lady Macbeth at the Metropolitan Opera, and with her October 11 performance she launches the house's celebrated <em>Live in HD</em> season of transmissions to movie theaters worldwide. She returns to the Met early in the New Year to star in a new staging of Tchaikovsky's <em>Iolanta</em>, which will be broadcast <em>Live in HD</em> on Valentine's Day. Other highlights of her season include her portrayal of Mimì opposite Joseph Calleja's Rodolfo in <em>La bohème</em> at Covent Garden and her return to the title role in <em>Anna Bolena</em> at Zurich Opera and Vienna State Opera.

        "biography": "<p>\n\tAprile Millo holds the distinction of being considered today's true Verdi soprano. Critics worldwide have confirmed this unique position comparing her to such legendary artists as Renata Tebaldi, Claudia Muzio, Zinka Milanov, and Maria Callas for her seamless legato, Italianate color and beauty of voice wed to dramatic commitment.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOne critic wrote of a recital in Spain: \"There is no mistaking the real thing. Millo is all about communication, immediate and intense, a beguiling mix of the spiritual and the carnal...Breathtaking piani and gorgeous sounds\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMillo burst upon the operatic scene at the Metropolitan Opera in a dramatic last minute replacement of an ailing colleague, as Amelia in Verdi's <em>Simon Boccanegra</em> on December 3rd, 1984.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHailed as \"the new Verdi Star,\" Millo subsequently went on to become an audience favorite and the head of the Verdi wing at the Metropolitan Opera, performing in nine Verdi operas: <em>Aida</em>, <em>Otello</em>, <em>Luisa Miller</em>, <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em>, <em>Il Trovatore</em>, <em>Don Carlo</em>, <em>Ernani</em>, and was the first Griselda in Met history for the premiere of<em> l Lombardi</em>. Additionally, she starred in Giordano's <em>Andrea Chenier</em>, Boito's <em>Mefistofole</em> and Puccini's <em>Tosca</em> and Turand<em></em>ot, and Ponchielli's <em>La Gioconda</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMillo added <em>Adriana Lecouvreur</em> to her repertory in 2002, debuting it with The Opera Orchestra of New York with Eve Queler at Carnegie Hall. Millo's association with The Opera Orchestra of New York has encompassed triumphs in <em>I Lombardi</em> with Carlo Bergonzi, <em>La Wally</em>, <em>Il Pirata</em>, and most recently the sold-out performances of her first <em>La Gioconda</em> and the highly acclaimed Minnie in <em>La Fanciulla del West</em> in 2004. \"The audience reaction was explosive; I was half-prepared for a frenzied rush to the stage at her curtain calls....A white-hot performance by Millo!!!\" wrote Brian Kellow for Opera News. Newsday wrote, \"Millo is the high-priestess of that old time operatic religion, her singing brought the audience to a foot-stomping frenzy!…\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMme Millo has also triumphed in the theaters of Frankfurt, Barcelona, Parma, Rome, Bologna, Torino, the Arena of Verona, The Baths of Caracalla, Munich, Berlin, Vienna, Paris, Orange, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paolo, Santiago, Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires, and, of course, La Scala, Milan. She has collaborated with such great conductor as Herbert von Karajan, and Riccardo Muti (both at La Scala), as well as James Levine, and Giuseppe Sinopoli, and has sung in productions by the greatest stage directors, including Liù in Turandot for with Franco Zeffirelli. She was also chosen by Maestro Zefferelli to be the voice of Elizabeth Taylor for the film Young Toscanini.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMillo's recordings include her debut disc of Verdi arias, (the best selling classical recording of that year for Angel EMI), and for Sony Classical, <em>Aida</em>, <em>Don Carlo</em>, <em>Luisa Miller</em>, and <em>Il Trovatore</em>, all under the direction of James Levine. The recordings have elicited the most enthusiastic reviews. Alan Blyth of Gramophone writes of her Leonora, \" Millo's account of the aria 'Tacea La Notte' matches some of the very best on disc. Throughout, her part is replete with right kind of Verdian spinto sound, the correct phraseology and inner feeling for the role. A reading to please the ear and move the heart.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMillo has been seen and heard on worldwide television, in the Emmy award winning broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera of <em>Aida</em> with Domingo and Levine, and the Live From The Met Broadcast of <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em> for The Great Performances Series on PBS with Luciano Pavarotti and James Levine. Both are now available on DVD.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOf Millo's Metropolitan <em>Tosca</em> the critics wrote \"…thunderous ovation after ovation for the return of this artist to her artistic home…gleaming high notes…opulent sound….\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMme Millo's first performances of the 21st Century included performances of Verdi's <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em>, for her debut in Lisbon, Portugal, and for performances of <em>Tosca</em> for the Teatro Dell'Opera in Rome.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMillo is the recipient of numerous prizes and awards. In 1978, by unanimous decision, The First Prize in The Voci Verdiane Concorso in Busetto, Italy, the birthplace of Giuseppe Verdi. The Francisco Vinas Prize in Spain followed in 1978, The Montserrat Caballe-Bernabe Merti Special Verdi Prize, The Geraldine Farrar Award in San Diego in 1979, The Richard Tucker Foundation Award in 1985, and the very special award in 1986 from The Maria Callas Foundation Award.\n</p>",

His early work was based on his own material, and he received some notice for the film <em>Exotica</em> (1994), but it was Atom Egoyan's first attempt at adapted material that resulted in his best-known work, <em>The Sweet Hereafter</em> (1997), which landed him an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Egoyan has directed several operas, including <em>Salome</em>, <em>Così fan tutte</em>, and the <em>Ring Cycle</em>, all at the Canadian Opera Company.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also directed the film <em>Sarabande</em>, starring Lori Singer and Khanjian, a drama which flanks cellist Yo-Yo Ma's performance of Bach's Fourth Suite for Unaccompanied Cello, as part of the latter's Inspired by Bach series for Sony Classical. The film <em>Ararat</em> (2002) generated much publicity for Atom Egoyan. After Henri Verneuil's French-language film <em>Mayrig</em> (1991), it was the first major motion picture to deal directly with the Armenian Genocide. <em>Ararat</em> later won the Best Picture prize at the Genie Awards.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAtom Egoyan has won the Cannes Film Festival four times and is widely considered the most famous Armenian filmmaker since Sergei Parajanov. The Egyptian-born, Canadian-raised, Oscar-nominated master of indie cinema has also won four awards from the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival. His most recent film <em>Chloe</em> (2009) is a remake based off Anne Fontaine's French film<em>Nathalie…</em>. <em>Chloe</em> stars Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried. The film is a psychological drama about jealousy and sexuality. The film deals with a complicated triangle love affair and clearly grapples with questions of the power of feminine sexuality. Sexuality is a theme common to Egoyan's work such as<em>Exotica</em> (1994) and <em>Where the Truth Lies</em> (1995). Chloe is a departure in many ways from Egoyan's earlier works, this film is more mainstream and draws more star power. It is also the first of his features for which he has not written the screenplay.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHis feature films include: <em>Next of Kin</em> (1984), <em>Family Viewing</em> (1987), <em>Speaking Parts</em> (1989), <em>The Adjuster</em> (1991), <em>Calendar</em> (1993), <em>Exotica</em> (1994), <em>The Sweet Hereafter</em> (1997), <em>Felicia's Journey</em> (1999), <em>Ararat</em> (2002), <em>Where the Truth Lies</em>(2005), <em>Adoration</em> (2008), <em>Seven Wonders</em> (2008) and <em>Chloe</em> (2009).\n</p>",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tBarbara Hannigan is known worldwide as a soprano of vital expressive force directed by exceptional technique. She is now bringing that same high energy and expertise to her varied activites as a conductor while continuing to work, as a singer, with the most prominent maestros, including in recent seasons Simon Rattle, Kent Nagano, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Andris Nelsons, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Ludovic Morlot, David Zinman, Alan Gilbert and Reinbert De Leeuw.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBlessed with a voice at once pure and hot, she has arrived, through challenging and diverse repertory choices, at a point of complete control, intensity and versatility. She also possesses an exciting stage presence, whether in opera or on the concert platform. Much sought after in contemporary music (she has given over 80 world premieres), she is no less brilliant and devoted a performer of Baroque and Classical music. Bringing freshness to older music and authority to new, she is among the very few singers whose every performance is an occasion.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tShe is a frequent guest of the Berliner Philharmoniker, who commissioned for her Hans Abrahamsen's symphonic song cycle <em>let me tell you</em>, a work which her performances has rapidly launched around the world. In 2014 she had the rare honour of an invitation as Artiste Étoile to the Lucerne Festival, where she conducted, gave master classes, and presented a work written for her by Unsuk Chin.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGyörgy Ligeti and Henri Dutilleux both regarded her as their soprano of choice. Her startling dramatic interpretation of Ligeti's <em>Mysteries of the Macabre</em> has been acclaimed widely, as has her expressive fullness in Dutilleux's <em>Correspondances</em>. Her recording of this work has garnered awards from Grammophone, Edison, and Victoires de la Musique. Other awards include \"Sängerin des Jahres\" (Opernwelt, 2013), Personalité Musicale de l'Année (Syndicat de la Presse Francaise, 2012),\n</p>\n<p>\n\tPart of Hannigan's outstanding quality comes from bringing to the concert platform the dramatic verve and character one might expect on the opera stage – and from retaining, as an opera performer, all the musicianship she displays as a concert artist. She is, whether in concert hall or opera house, a full being. And she has worked tirelessly with directors and conductors to achieve that fullness, and to go on expanding it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tUnforgettable opera appearances have included most recently an extraordinary embodying of the title role in <em>Lulu</em>, in Krzysztof Warlikowski's staging at La Monnaie, and a fearless interpretation of Marie as a flame in the darkness of Zimmermann's <em>Die Soldaten</em> at the Bayerische Staatsoper, a hugely acclaimed presentation directed by Andreas Kriegenberg and conducted by Kirill Petrenko. To the premiere production of George Benjamin's <em>Written on Skin</em> she brought a gripping portrayal of a young woman in dawning self-realization. She has also worked with choreographer Sasha Waltz on productions of Hosokawa's <em>Matsukaze</em> and Dusapin's <em>Passion</em>, thoroughly utilizing her physical as well as vocal agility. In future seasons she will add Mélisande, Elle in <em>La Voix humaine</em> and the title role in Gerald Barry's <em>Alice in Wonderland </em>to the repertory of characters she vividly inhabits.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tShe is steadily developing her range as a conductor. From a first and much applauded experience conducting Stravinsky's <em>Renard</em> at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, she has gone on to work with orchestras including the Göteborgs Symfoniker, Prague Philharmonic, WDR Symphony Orchestra, Mahler Chamber Orchestra, l'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Avanti Chamber Orchestra, Britten Sinfonia, Orchestra della Toscana, and Gulbenkian Orchestra. As a performer herself, she enjoys a warm rapport with orchestral players, and this communicates itself in her concerts, while her programming has music old and new striking sparks off each other. Her conducting debut at the Concertgebouw with Ludwig Orchestra, won the Ovatie 2014 award for best classical concert of the year in the Netherlands.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHer 2014-15 season includes return engagements with the Berliner Philharmoniker, to sing the new Chin piece and Grisey's <em>Quatre chants pour franchir le seuil</em>, both with Rattle conducting. She gives the world premieres of works by Magnus Lindberg, with the London Philharmonic under Vladimir Jurowski, and Salvatore Sciarrino, with the Accademia di Santa Cecilia under Antonio Pappano. As artist-in-residence at the Toronto Symphony New Creations Festival she presents <em>let me tell you</em> and <em>Written on Skin</em>. She is Donna Anna in a new <em>Don Giovanni</em> at La Monnaie, again directed by Warlikowski, and repeats her performances as Marie in Munich and Agnes in New York. Not least, she makes her debut with the Vienna Philharmonic, singing Claude Vivier's <em>Lonely Child</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Author: Paul Griffith</em>\n</p>",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tA graduate of McGill University in Montreal and U. C. Berkeley, Brian Current writes music that is brimming with energy – sometimes with the propulsive rhythms of so-called minimalist music, sometimes with a more delicate sense of flux, but almost always with a sense of motion and playfulness about the treatment of time and texture. These features have won him numerous honors, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Barlow Prize for Orchestral Music, and Italy's Premio Fedora for his new chamber opera <em>Airline Icarus</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTemporal plasticity is especially compelling in Current's large ensemble scores <em>For the Time Being</em> (1999) and <em>Symphonies in Slanted Time</em> (2005). In the latter, Current explains, the music \"is always speeding up or always slowing down. Rather than write music for a steady metronome, I wondered if it were possible to make the change in tempo the normal state of the music... using rejuvenation to create constantly changing textures.\" He has put these principles to a variety of expressive uses, in such works as the recent <em>Whirling Dervish</em> (2010) or the orchestral tone poem <em>Kazabazua</em> (2002, rev. 2006) which describes the \"flow and restlessness\" of a partially underground river in the Gatineau hills north of Ottawa.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCurrent's virtuoso handling of instrumental ensembles stems in part from his work as a conductor, which has placed him at the helm of a dozen or so ensembles and symphony orchestras. Also perhaps linked to his experience on the conductor's podium is a very sensitive, almost tactile treatment of musical texture–the interplay between discrete lines of material or groups of players in the moment of performance. This preoccupation is readily apparent in <em>This Isn't Silence</em> (1998, rev. 2001) which lends its title to a CD of his music released by Centredisques in 2007. It can also be heard in Current's<em>Concertino</em> for flute, string orchestra, and three flutes dispersed around the concert hall. Here, the composer \"imagined blanketing the hall of with the sound of flutes positioned at the back of the room. At times they act as distant relatives to the solo line but more often they fill out the sound with tumbling gestures of their own.\" A similarly imaginative handling of texture can be in Current's 2009 score, <em>Strata.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCombining his activities as composer and conductor, Current has engaged in some astonishing and successful public interventions on behalf of new music. Since 2006, he has been artistic director and conductor of the Royal Conservatory of Music's New Music Ensemble in Toronto. In 2009, he supervised a 12-hour, 200-person installation-performance of James Tenney's <em>In a Large Open Space,</em> which drew an estimated 15,000 people to the opening of the Conservatory's new Koerner Hall. He has also composed a real-time introduction to twentieth-and twenty-first-century music called <em>This Isn't Silence: A Young Person's Guide to New Music for Symphony Orchestra</em> (2008), and in May 2010 he curated a concert series devoted to young composers that was aired on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation [CBC] Radio 2.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2001, Current's score <em>For the Time Being</em> won the Grand Prize in the CBC's National Competition for Young Composers, after which it was honored by the International Rostrum of Composers in Paris and was selected as part of the inaugural concert program for the 2002 Warsaw Autumn Festival. Next month, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet will take on tour a full-evening ballet featuring three of Current's scores alongside works by John Estacio. And later this season, the Kitchener Waterloo Symphony Orchestra will give the world premiere of <em>Whirling Dervish, for Sufi Whirling and Symphony Orchestra,</em> commissioned with funds from the Barlow Endowment.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t© Beth Levy, San Francisco Contemporary Music Players\n</p>",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tAmerican bass-baritone Christian Van Horn has appeared with many of the world's most prestegious opera companies, including San Francisco Opera, the Metropolitan Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Bayerische Staatsoper, the Salzburg Festival, Los Angeles Opera, Grand Théâtre du Genève, and Canadian Opera Company. His roles include the title role in <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em>, the Four Villains in <em>Les Contes d'Hoffmann</em>, Mephistopheles in <em>Faust</em>, Raimondo in <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, Banquo in <em>Macbeth</em>, Colline in <em>La Bohème</em>, and Claudio in <em>Aggrippina</em>. Mr. Van Horn has also appeared as a concert soloist with the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic among others.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"color_14\">During the 2012/13 season, Christian traveled to Perm, Russia, where he recorded the title role in <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> with conductor Teodor Currentzis for Sony Classical Records (due for release in early 2014). He continued to Amsterdam to make his house and role debuts as Gessler in Rossini's <em>Guillaume Tell</em> with De Nederlandse Opera, followed by another house debut with Dallas Opera as Timur in <em>Turandot</em>. Christian continued the season with a significant role debut, singing his first Four Villains in <em>Les Contes d'Hoffmann</em> with San Francisco Opera. \"Bass-baritone Christian Van Horn's resonant vocalism and suave, menacing presence animated Lindorf, Coppélius, Dr. Miracle and Dapertutto; the latter's 'Scintille, diamant' yielded an episode of focused brilliance.\" (Opera News, August 2013) The summer then saw him back across the ocean with the Gothenburg Symphoniker in Sweden for a concert performance of Ça Ira, written by Roger Waters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"color_14\">To open the 2013/14 season, Van Horn returned to Canadian Opera Company as Colline in <em>La Bohème</em>. Most recently, he made his Metropolitan Opera debut under the baton of James Levine as Pistola in the Met's new <em>Falstaff</em> which was presented around the globe as part of the HD Broadcast series. Christian then sang more performances of Colline in the Met's beloved Zeffirelli production, showcasing his \"sturdy voice and commanding presence.\" (New York Times, January 2014) He rounds out the season with a return to Lyric Opera of Chicago as Publio in <em>La Clemenza di Tito</em>. This production marks Mr. Van Horn's tenth outing with the company, having most recently delivered triumphant performances of Raimondo in <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em> in 2011. Opera News proclaimed that Christian \"contributed some of the most beautiful singing of the evening.\" (December 2011)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"color_14\">Christian will spend much of the 2014/15 season with San Francisco Opera where he will be seen in six different productions, including the company's season opening performances of <em>Norma</em> (Oroveso) under Maestro Nicola Luisotti. San Francisco will also hear Van Horn in two role debuts: Alidoro in <em>La Cenerentola</em> and Narbal in <em>Les Troyens</em>, conducted by Donald Runnicles. The remainder of his San Francisco season includes Colline and the world premiere of SFO-commissioned <em>La Chociara</em> by Marco Tutino. Christian makes his San Diego Opera debut as Colline in early 2015 and also returns to the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich as Offenbach's Four Villains. The season is completed with concert performances and a recording of composer Joseph Summer's new opera, The Tempest, which Van Horn will headline as Prospero.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"color_14\">In addition to the upcoming release of Sony Classical's Figaro, Christian Van Horn can also be heard on several previously-released commercial recordings. These include Bizet's Carmen with Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic for EMI, a live recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with Leon Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra, and the world premiere of David Carlson's <em>Anna Karenina</em> for Signum Classics with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and Maestro Stewart Robertson. Christian may be seen on DVD in the Salzburg Festival's production of <em>Roméo et Juliette</em>, conducted by Yannick Nezet-Seguin (Deutsche Grammaphon) as well as in Christoph Loy's production of <em>Lucrezia Borgia</em> with the Bayerische Staatsoper for Medici Arts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"color_14\">Other past season highlights have included appearances with the Santa Fe Opera, Boston Lyric Opera, Florida Grand Opera, Oper Stuttgart, Chicago Opera Theater, and the Seattle Symphony, to name a few. Mr. Van Horn holds both a Master of Music and an Artists Diploma in Voice and Opera from Yale University where he studied with Richard Cross. Christian was a member of the Ryan Opera Center for two years with Lyric Opera of Chicago and spent two seasons on the ensemble roster of the Bayerische Staatsoper.

        "biography": "<p>\n\tPraised for his \"sweetly rendered, fluid and pliable tenor voice\", Christopher Mayell is quickly making his mark as a rising star in Canada's opera houses and concerts halls. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tFrom his acclaimed presentation of Britten's ALBERT HERRING in St. John's, Newfoundland, to his interpretation of Handel's SOLOMON in Victoria, British Columbia, Christopher maintains a hearty schedule of engagements across the country. Future performances include Verdi's FALSTAFF with Calgary Opera, Offenbach's LA VIE PARISIENNE with Toronto Operetta Theatre, and Haydn's LORD NELSON MASS with the Stratford Concert Choir. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tRecent appearances include a debut performance of Bach's renowned Cantata No. 55 'ICH ARMER MENSCH' with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, Bach's CHRISTMAS ORATORIO with the Kingston Symphony, Mozart's GREAT MASS IN C MINOR and Orff's CARMINA BURANA with the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, Mozart's REQUIEM with the Grammy-nominated Elora Festival Singers. He has also joined the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra as well as Orchestra London for performances of Handel's glorious MESSIAH. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tChristopher is enjoying a growing international presence, including a portrayal of the title role in a world-class production of ALBERT HERRING at the Aldeburgh Festival in England (alongside soprano Felicity Lott), as well as a nationwide tour of China. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tChristopher is also a champion of new Canadian works, including Opera NUOVA's commissioned opera for younger audiences, THE LIVES OF LESSER THINGS, which toured extensively in Alberta. He also continues to work closely with Toronto's Tapestry New Opera Works in their development of new works, including Richard Payne's GET STUFFED!, and Aaron Gervais' OKSANA G. This season, he gave a debut performance with Toronto's Continuum New Music, performing a world-premier performance of 'FREDERICK'S DOCTOR', a narrative for tenor and instrumental ensemble. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tChristopher is a proud alumnus of the Calgary Opera Emerging Artist Ensemble program, through which he performed roles in Verdi's RIGOLETTO, Moore's THE BALLAD OF BABY DOE (Canadian premier), and Richard Strauss' ARIADNE AUF NAXOS (featured on CBC Radio's Saturday Afternoon at the Opera). While in Calgary, he was also featured by the Spiritus Chamber Choir in a national CBC Radio broadcast performance of Respighi's LAUDATE PER LA NATIVITA DEL SIGNORE. <br>\n\t<br>\n\tChristopher's endeavours are made possible by support from the Ontario Arts Council's Chalmers Professional Development Grant program, as well as through a generous grant from the Canadian Aldeburgh Foundation.<br>\n</p>",

Nor have they won an Emmy Award as a TV host at 16. Danielle de Niese, born in Melbourne, Australia to Sri Lankan parents (her father with Dutch roots, her mother part-Scottish), has been on her unstoppable path since the age of eight. She's an irresistible fireball with her own beguiling way of approaching her art. There really isn't anyone quite like her.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDanielle's opera singer career has included countless starring roles, in such productions as <a href=\"http://www.danielledeniese.com/index.php/en/music/dvds\"><strong>The Marriage of Figaro</strong></a> (in which she made her first appearance at the Met as Barbarina at a mere 19), Così fan tutte, Orpheus and Eurydice and Acis and Galatea, L'Elisir d'amore, Don Pasquale. Danielle has performed with the <strong>New York Philharmonic</strong>, the Cleveland Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields and many others, on the world-famous opera stages of Paris, Naples, Madrid, Zurich, Berlin, San Francisco, Chicago, Tokyo, Sydney, the Royal Opera House Covent Garden and far beyond.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tShe's been a recording star since she made her studio debut with Decca/Universal Records releasing <a href=\"http://www.danielledeniese.com/index.php/en/music/danielle-music\"><strong>Handel Arias</strong></a> in 2007, most recently her fourth studio album <a href=\"http://www.danielledeniese.com/index.php/en/music/danielle-music\"><strong>Beauty of the Baroque</strong></a>. As 2013 came to an end, she was captivating a select Mayfair audience with a recital at the Arts Club's classical festival before starring as Poppea in Handel's Agrippina at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona. That reunited her with producer David McVicar, in whose award-winnng production of<a href=\"http://www.danielledeniese.com/index.php/en/music/dvds\"><strong> Handel's Giulio Cesare </strong></a>she catapulted to world fame at <strong>Glyndebourne </strong>in 2005.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are some of the specifics, but they only begin to tell Danielle's story. With her effervescent attitude and highly developed self-awareness, she is the opera star to delight the devoted aficionado, and to lure the first-time visitor.\n</p>",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tDavid Daniels is known for his superlative artistry, magnetic stage presence and a voice of singular warmth and surpassing beauty, which have helped him redefine his voice category for the modern public. The American countertenor has appeared with the world's major opera companies and on its main concert and recital stages. He made history as the first countertenor to give a solo recital in the main auditorium of Carnegie Hall. The <em>Chicago Tribune</em> has called Daniels \"today's gold standard among countertenors.\" <em>Gramophone</em> magazine acknowledged his contribution to recorded excellence as well as his expansion of the repertoire for his voice type by naming him one of the \"Top Ten Trailblazers\" in classical music today.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 2014 – 2015 season will see David Daniels in the title role of Theodore Morrison's Oscar, based on the life of Oscar Wilde, in a company debut and East coast premiere with Opera Philadelphia. Daniels will also make his company debut with the Wiener Staatsoper in the Robert Lepage production of <em>The Tempest</em> as Trinculo, conducted by the composer, Thomas Adès. He will also return to San Francisco Opera to sing the role of Arsace in <em>Paretenope</em>, directed by Chrisopher Alden. Concert performances include the Bach Mass in B Minor with the American Classical Orchestra at Alice Tully Hall, Handel's <em>Messiah</em> with the University Musical Society in Ann Arbor, and an gala performance with soprano Laura Claycomb and Mercury Houston. Additional appearances include a recital with Martin Katz at the Converse College with the Friends of Petrie School of Music in his home town of Spartanburg, SC.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid Daniels' 2013 – 2014 season was highlighted by a return to a role he originated at The Metropolitan Opera: Prospero in <em>The Enchanted Island</em> opposite Susan Graham and Plácido Domingo. Daniels also sang Lichas in the Peter Sellars production of <em>Hercules</em> with the Canadian Opera Company under the baton of Harry Bicket, opposite Alice Coote and Eric Owens. With Gran Teatre del Liceu, Daniels sang Ottone in David McVicar's production of <em>Agrippina</em> and with The English Concert he sang Didymus in Handel's rarely heard <em>Theodora</em>, opposite longtime colleague Dorothea Röschmann, in an international concert tour culminating with a performance at Carnegie Hall. Concert engagements included Pergolesi's <em>Stabat Mater</em> with conductor Nicholas McGegan and the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra. Recital engagements include appearances with Collaborative Arts Institute of Chicago, the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid, as well as a special guest appearance at Marilyn Horne's 80th Birthday Song Celebration alongside Renée Fleming, Samuel Ramey, and Frederica von Stade, among others.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t Other highlights included the title role of Radamisto at Theatre an der Wien as well as an international concert tour of the same opera with The English Concert under the direction of Harry Bicket which included performances in Paris, Birmingham Town, London, Toulouse, Ann Arbor, and culminated with a performance at Carnegie Hall.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong> </strong>Highly sought after for the works of Handel, Monteverdi, Gluck, Mozart and Britten, David Daniels has been featured on the great operatic stages of the world to overwhelming critical acclaim. Highlights of recent seasons inc<strong></strong>lude multiple appearances at the Metropolitan Opera as the title role of <em>Giulio Cesare</em> in David McVicar's inventive production, Prospero in the Baroque pastiche <em>The Enchanted Island</em>, and in the title role of Gluck's <em>Orfeo ed Euridice </em>in a new production marking Mark Morris' debut at the Met as a stage director and conducted by music director James Levine. Appearances at the Lyric Opera of Chicago include the title role in Handel's <em>Rinaldo, </em>Oberon in Britten's <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, and Lichas in Peter Sellars new production of Handel's <em>Hercules</em>. Additional appearances include Arsamenes in Handel's <em>Xerxes</em> and Bertarido in Handel's <em>Rodelinda </em>with the San Francisco Opera. At Santa Fe Opera his role debut as Roberto in Vivaldi's <em>Griselda</em>, the work's first major U.S. production by Peter Sellars, drew rave reviews as did the world premiere of Theodore Morrison's <em>Oscar</em>, based on the life of Oscar Wilde of which the New York Times lauded \"Mr. Daniels was superb, not only singing but also acting the role with a savvy Wildean mix of arrogance and vulnerability. His sustained tone was beautiful, and his occasional purposeful flirtations with a baritonal register were amusing.<strong>\"</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Daniels gave his first performances in the title role of Handel's <em>Orlando</em> at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich, and his portrayal as Didymus in Peter Sellars' renowned production of <em>Theodora </em>at the Glyndebourne Festival is available on CD and DVD. Mr. Daniels has also performed opposite Plácido Domingo in the title role in Washington National Opera's production of Handel's <em>Tamerlano, </em>which he also sang at the Bayerische Staatsoper. Further Handelian heroes include the title role in<em>Giulio Cesare</em> at the Metropolitan Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, and Glyndebourne Festival, Arsace in <em>Partenope </em>with Vienna's Theater an der Wien and Lyric Opera of Chicago, the title role in <em>Radamisto</em> with Santa Fe Opera, and David in <em>Saul</em> with the Bayerische Staatsoper. Other notable roles include Oberon in Britten's<em>Midsummer Night's Dream</em> with the Metropolitan Opera, Teatro alla Scala, and Barcelona's Teatre del Liceu (available on DVD), Ottone in Monteverdi's <em>L'incoronazione di Poppea</em> at Los Angeles Opera opposite Susan Graham, Nerone in the same opera at the Bayerische Staatsoper, and Farnace in Mozart's <em>Mitridate </em>at Covent Garden.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tEqually at home in recital as on the opera stage, David Daniels has won admiration for his performances of extensive concert and art song repertoire, including song literature of the 19th and 20th centuries not usually associated with his voice type. Following his Carnegie Hall recital debut in 2002, the <em>New York Times</em> reported, \"There was a sense of occasion in the air, and he didn't disappoint. This was a compelling, even exhilarating recital, covering a wide range of bases in six distinctive sets.\" Daniels has given recitals at London's Wigmore Hall, New York's Avery Fisher Hall, Alice Tully Hall and Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center; at Munich's Prinzregententheater and Vienna's Konzerthaus; in Barcelona's Teatre del Liceu; at the Edinburgh, Tanglewood and Ravinia Festivals; as well as in Ann Arbor, Atlanta, Chicago, Lisbon, Toronto, Vancouver and Washington. His French recital debut was a sold-out performance at the Salle Gaveau in Paris.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn concert, Mr. Daniels made his debut with the Berlin Philharmonic in Bach's b minor Mass, conducted by Sir Roger Norrington and has toured Europe with the Basel Chamber Orchestra and mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kožená. Also in Europe, Daniels performed works by Bach and Vivaldi with Fabio Biondi and the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Daniels collaborated with Maestro Labadie in Bach's <em>St. John</em> <em>Passion </em>for his Chicago Symphony Orchestra debut. He has toured extensively with long-time collaborator Harry Bicket and The English Concert, performing in London, Toulouse, Vienna, Munich, Vancouver, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City. He made his Philadelphia Orchestra debut under conductor Bernard Labadie, and has sung with the New York Philharmonic and St. Louis and Seattle Symphonies. He has also sung with the San Francisco Symphony with Sir Andrew Davis.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAn accomplished recording artist with several critically-acclaimed and best-selling solo albums to his credit, David Daniels's latest release was a collection of Bach's Sacred Arias and Cantatas conducted by Harry Bicket with The English Concert. He has also released a recording of Pergolesi's Stabat Mater as well as solo works by the composer in a disc with soprano Dorothea Röschmann and conductor Fabio Biondi. Showing his diverse musical personality, another release featured Berlioz's song cycle <em>Les Nuits d'été</em>, and also included songs by Ravel and Fauré conducted by John Nelson. <em>The New York Times</em> wrote, \"The term 'countertenor star' used to be an oxymoron, but David Daniels, for one, has made it a reality. There's no faulting his artistry. He has an unusually round, warm sound. He certainly knows his instrument.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOther recordings include <em>A Quiet Thing</em> (with guitarist Craig Ogden), and a recording of Handel's <em>Rinaldo</em> on the Decca label in which he sang the title role opposite Cecilia Bartoli, and which received a <em>Gramophone </em>Editor's Choice Album of the Year award. His debut disc was <em>Handel: Opera Arias</em> conducted by Sir Roger Norrington, followed by <em>Sento Amor</em>, with arias by Mozart, Gluck and Handel, and <em>Serenade,</em> a recital of songs by Beethoven, Gounod, Poulenc, Schubert and others with his frequent piano partner Martin Katz.\n</p>",

Her ability to reach to the heart of music and text has earned her both the devotion of an exceptionally diverse audience, and the awards and distinctions accorded to only the most distinguished of artists.

        "biography": "<p>\n\tDean Burry was born in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1972, but grew up in the small town of Gander. As both his parents' families came from small outport communities, he spent a great deal of time by the ocean and out in his father's boat. Music is in the blood of Newfoundlanders, and it was in this environment that Burry began his own artistic journey. Early piano lessons were not completely satisfying, and it wasn't until a teacher encouraged his desire for composition, at age 10, that music became a passion. Theatre was another great interest and soon he was writing plays and music for the school drama club. His first produced script, <em>Good Gods</em>, won the local drama festival in 1987.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing high school, Burry began studies as a saxophone major at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. In seeking ways to combine his love of theatre and music, he began composing operas and musicals. In his firsts three years at Mt.A, he wrote, produced and conducted three major dramatic musical works: <em>The Resurrection</em>, <em>Joe and Mary Had a Baby</em> and <em>Unto the Earth: Vignettes of a War</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t Shortly after completing composition studies at the University of Toronto, Burry began working in the box office at the Canadian Opera Company while composing incidental music for small theatrical productions. Working in the box office was the opening he needed to begin immersing himself in the Canadian opera world. Most lunches were spent upstairs in the library or chatting with the Education and Outreach Coordinator. He was able to attend rehearsals and learn a great deal about the ways to create successful opera. In 1997, Burry was hired to create and run the After-school Opera Program; a community program designed to expose children to all the elements of opera. The program has met with great success and is approaching its fifteenth season.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t In 1998, while working as an educator with the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto, he was commissioned to write <a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/the-brothers-grimm/\"><em>The Brothers Grimm</em></a>. The opera was a great success and was the first work to put the composer on a national stage. <em>The Brothers Grimm</em> has been seen by over 150,000 school children across Canada, the United States and Europe since 2001. In December, 2012, the Canadian Opera Company celebrated the 500<sup>th</sup> performance of the opera with a fairy tale festival called GrimmFest. The performance coincided with the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the publication of the Grimm's work. <em>The</em> <em>Brothers Grimm</em> is believed to be the most performed Canadian opera ever and possibly the most performed 21st century opera.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t Other major works include <em><a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/under-the-night/\">Under the Night</a>, The Heart That Knows</em> and <em><a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/home-and-away/\">Home and Away</a></em> for Live Bait Theatre, <em>Songs of the Island</em> for the Charlottetown Festival,<em><a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/the-hobbit/\">The Hobbit</a> and The Secret World of OG </em>for the Canadian Children's Opera Company<em>, <a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/isis-and-the-seven-scorpions/\">Isis and the Seven Scorpions</a></em> for the Canadian Opera Company,<a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/pandoras-locker/\"><em>Pandora's Locker</em></a> for The Glenn Gould School, <a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/a-creature-of-habit/\"><em>A Creature of Habit</em></a> and Beacon of Light for Rising Tide Theatre. <a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/the-mummers-masque/\"><em>The Mummers' Masque</em></a> for Toronto Masque Theatre, the CBC serial radio opera <a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/baby-kintyre/\"><em>Baby Kintyre</em> </a>(subsequently nominated for a Prix Italia International Broadcast Award) <a href=\"http://deanburry.squarespace.com/the-bremen-town-musicians/\"><em>The Bremen Town Musicians</em></a> with Opera Lyra, <em>Angela and Her Sisters</em> for the University of Manitoba and The Vinland Traveler and <em>Le nez de la sorcière</em> for Memorial University of Newfoundland.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t Current projects include a setting of the Alfred Noyes poem <em>The Highwayman</em> for soprano and chamber ensemble and <em>The Sword in the Schoolyard</em>, a King Arthur opera for Toronto's VIVA! Youth Singers.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t Burry's radio opera, <em>Baby Kintyre</em> (commissioned by CBC Radio) was nominated for a Prix Italia and he was given the prestigious Louis Applebaum Composers Award in 2011 for his work in music for young people.\n</p>",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tDeborah Voigt is increasingly recognized as one of the world's most versatile singers and one of music's most endearing personalities. Through her performances and television appearances, she is known for the singular power and beauty of her voice, as well as for her captivating stage presence. Having made her name as a leading dramatic soprano, she is internationally revered for her performances in the operas of Wagner, Strauss, and more, and is also an active recitalist and performer of Broadway standards and popular songs. Besides boasting an extensive discography, she appears regularly as both performer and host in the Metropolitan Opera's Live in HD series, which is transmitted live to movie theaters around the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 2014-15 season sees one of Voigt's most personal projects come to fruition, with HarperCollins's publication of her candid, funny, and soul-baring memoir <i>Call Me Debbie: True Confessions of a Down-to-Earth Diva</i>. She returns to the opera house, reprising her star turn in Francesca Zambello's <i>Salome</i> for her Dallas Opera debut; making her title role debut in a new staging of <i>The Merry Widow</i> at Michigan Opera Theater; and undertaking the roles of Elisabeth and Venus in <i>Tannhäuser</i> at the Hamburg State Opera—her first time singing both parts in the same production. In concert, she headlines the Las Vegas Philharmonic's opening-night gala and season-closing events at both the Pacific Symphony and the University of Southern Mississippi Symphony, which she joins for An Evening with Deborah Voigt. As WQXR's inaugural Susan W.

Her recording of Strauss's<i> Egyptian Helen </i>was another <i>Billboard</i> bestseller and was again named one of the best of the year by <i>Opera News</i>. Deutsche Grammophon released a live recording of Voigt's headlining role debut in the 2003 Vienna State Opera <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>, as well as a Blu-ray DVD set of her starring role as Brünnhilde in Robert Lepage's visionary Ring cycle at the Met, which won the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording of 2013.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA devotee of Broadway and American song, Voigt has given acclaimed performances of popular fare, including benefit concerts for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and New York Theatre Workshop. She has sung with Barbara Cook and Dianne Reeves at the Hollywood Bowl, and given performances in Lincoln Center's long-running American Songbook series, singing Broadway and popular standards. In the summer of 2011 Voigt won praise as Annie Oakley at the Glimmerglass Festival in Cooperstown, headlining both Irving Berlin's beloved <i>Annie Get Your Gun</i> and her own <i>Voigt Lessons</i>. Millions of viewers heard Voigt sing \"America the Beautiful\" on NBC's nationwide broadcast of Macy's Independence Day fireworks show in 2004, and later that year they witnessed her majestic ride down Broadway in Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. She has also been profiled by many important national media outlets, such as CBS's <i>60 Minutes</i>, <i>Good Morning America</i>, and <i>Vanity Fair</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tVoigt studied at California State University at Fullerton.

        "biography": "<p>\n\tBass-baritone Eric Owens has a unique reputation as an esteemed interpreter of classic works and a champion of new music. Equally at home in orchestral, recital, and operatic performances, Mr. Owens brings his powerful poise, expansive voice, and instinctive acting faculties to stages around the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Owens begins his 2014-2015 season by rejoining Sir Simon Rattle, Peter Sellars, and the Berlin Philharmonic for highly anticipated performances of Bach's <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> at the Lucerne Festival. Additional performances of the production take place at The BBC Proms festival and New York's Park Avenue Armory as part of Lincoln Center's White Light Festival. Mr. Owens opens his operatic season by returning to Lyric Opera of Chicago, where he has been appointed as their Community Ambassador, for performances of Gershwin's <em>Porgy and Bess</em> directed by Francesca Zambello. He will also appear in his title role debut of <em>Der</em> <em>fliegende</em> <em>Holländer</em> with the Washington National Opera conducted by Phillipe Auguin. Owens makes additional role debuts this season as King Philip II in Verdi's <em>Don Carlo</em> at Opera Philadelphia, Scarpia in Puccini's <em>Tosca</em> with Leonard Slatkin and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and the title role in Verdi's <em>Macbeth</em> at the Glimmerglass Festival where he returns as an Artist-in-Residence.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSymphonic highlights of the season include performances of Verdi's Requiem with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Alan Gilbert and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Andrew Davis, and Ravel's <em>L'enfant</em> <em>et</em> <em>les sortileges </em>with the Swedish Radio Symphony under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen. Mr. Owens and Mr. Salonen then bring <em>L'enfant</em> <em>et</em> <em>les sortileges</em> and Debussy's <em>Pelléas</em> <em>et Mélisande,</em> in which Mr. Owens makes his role debut as Golaud, to the United States for performances with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Owens can also be seen in performance with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Riccardo Muti in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.<br>\n\t<br>\n\tMr. Owens began his 2013-2014 season in Berlin, performing in Bach's <em>St. Matthew Passion</em> with the Berliner Philharmonic and Sir Simon Rattle. After mentoring the next generation of opera stars at the American Singers' Opera Project at the Kennedy Center with friend and collaborator Renée Fleming, Mr. Owens appeared as Sarastro in Mozart's <em>The Magic Flute</em> at the Metropolitan Opera. He made his role debut as Vodnik in <em>Rusalka</em> at Lyric Opera of Chicago at the start of 2014. In the spring, Mr. Owens joined what director Peter Sellars called his \"dream cast\" of Handel's <em>Hercules</em> with the Canadian Opera Company as the title role alongside Alice Coote, David Daniels, and Richard Croft, followed by his return to Wolf Trap Opera as their 2014 Artist in Residence. 2013-2014 also saw a duo recital with soprano Susanna Phillips presented by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Owens has created an uncommon niche for himself in the ever-growing body of contemporary opera works through his determined tackling of new and challenging roles. He received great critical acclaim for portraying the title role in the world premiere of Elliot Goldenthal's <em>Grendel</em> with the Los Angeles Opera, and again at the Lincoln Center Festival, in a production directed and designed by Julie Taymor. Mr. Owens also enjoys a close association with John Adams, for whom he performed the role of General Leslie Groves in the world premiere of <em>Doctor Atomic</em> at the San Francisco Opera, and of the Storyteller in the world premiere of <em>A Flowering Tree</em> at Peter Sellars's New Crowned Hope Festival in Vienna and later with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. <em>Doctor Atomic</em> was later recorded and received the 2012 Grammy for Best Opera Recording. Mr. Owens made his Boston Symphony Orchestra debut under the baton of David Robertson in Adams's Nativity oratorio <em>El Niño.</em><br>\n\t<br>\n\tMr. Owens's career operatic highlights include his San Francisco Opera debut in <em>Otello</em> conducted by Donald Runnicles; his Royal Opera, Covent Garden, debut in <em>Norma</em><em>; Aida</em> at Houston Grand Opera<em>;</em><em>Rigoletto</em>, <em>Il</em> <em>Trovatore</em>, and <em>La</em> <em>Bohème</em> at Los Angeles Opera; <em>Die</em> <em>Zauberflöte</em> for his Paris Opera (Bastille) debut; and <em>Ariodante</em> and <em>L'Incoronazione</em> <em>di</em> <em>Poppea</em> at the English National Opera. He sang Collatinus in a highly acclaimed Christopher Alden production of Britten's <em>The Rape of</em> <em>Lucretia</em> at Glimmerglass Opera. A former member of the Houston Grand Opera Studio, Mr. Owens has sung Sarastro, Mephistopheles in <em>Faust</em>, Frère Laurent, Angelotti in <em>Tosca,</em> and Aristotle Onassis in the world premiere of <em>Jackie O</em> (available on the Argo label) with that company. Mr. Owens is featured on two Telarc recordings with the Atlanta Symphony: Mozart's Requiem and scenes from Strauss' <em>Elektra</em> and <em>Die Frau</em> <em>ohne</em> <em>Schatten</em><em>,</em> both conducted by Donald Runnicles. He is featured on the Nonesuch Records release of <em>A Flowering Tree</em>. Mr. Owens has been recognized with multiple honors, including the 2003 Marian Anderson Award, a 1999 ARIA award, second prize in the Plácido Domingo Operalia Competition, the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, and the Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA native of Philadelphia, Mr. Owens began his musical training as a pianist at the age of six, followed by formal oboe study at age eleven under Lloyd Shorter of the Delaware Symphony and Louis Rosenblatt of the Philadelphia Orchestra. He studied voice while an undergraduate at Temple University, and then as a graduate student at the Curtis Institute of Music. He currently studies with Armen Boyajian. He serves on the Board of Trustees of both the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts and Astral Artistic Services.\n</p>",

His recent awards include a Grammy for Best Opera Recording 2012 (<em>Dr. Atomic</em> from the Met) and Best Solo Vocal Recording for his CD of Britten Songs (Hyperion) at the 2011 Classic FM Gramophone Awards for an unprecedented third time.

He was honoured at the 2009 Opera News Awards for distinguished achievement. His active relationship with leading conductors including Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Sir Simon Rattle, Bernard Haitink, Alan Gilbert, Mariss Jansons, Esa Pekka Salonen and Sir Antonio Pappano, has been part of a flourishing career.<br>\n\t<br>\n\tIn opera, Mr Finley has sung all the major baritone roles of Mozart.

        "biography": "<p>\n\tIt's not every prima donna who can boast a degree in biomedical engineering, but then, Isabel Bayrakdarian isn't your average prima donna—in fact, she'd probably demur at being called a prima donna at all. In a career still in its second decade, an eagerly anticipated visitor to opera houses and concert halls the world over, she's become as celebrated for her beauty, presence, and style as for a strikingly multihued voice that's wholly in sync with the rest of her.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA winner of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in 1997—the same year she graduated from the University of Toronto cum laude with that impressively nonmusical degree—Ms. Bayrakdarian thereafter found her career taking rapid wing. In 1999 she scored a notable success in the Lyric Opera of Chicago's world premiere production of William Bolcom's <em>A View from the Bridge</em>; the following year, she walked away from Plácido Domingo's prestigious Operalia competition with first prize. She launched 2002 with her San Francisco Opera debut, as Valencienne in <em>The Merry Widow</em>, and closed it with her Metropolitan Opera debut, in the New York premiere of Bolcom's opera; a season later, she won plaudits (and hearts) as Teresa in the belated Met premiere of Berlioz's <em>Benvenuto Cellini</em>. Mozart became a specialty: Zerlina in <em>Don Giovanni</em> (New York, Houston, Salzburg), Susanna in <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> (Los Angeles, London), and Pamina in <em>The Magic Flute</em> (New York, Toronto). \"How any man could not relent before the beautiful Isabel Bayrakdarian's ardent Pamina was a mystery,\" marveled the New York Times after her first Met <em>Flute</em>. But almost from the start, she's refused to be hemmed in to a particular period or style. Her roles at her home-base theater, Toronto's Canadian Opera Company, range from Gluck's Euridice to Debussy's Mélisande to Poulenc's Blanche in <em>Dialogues des Carmélites</em>; and away from home she's shone as Monteverdi's Poppea in Barcelona, Handel's Romilda (<em>Serse</em>) in Dresden, and Janáček's Vixen in New York, Florence, and the Saito Kinen Festival in Matsumoto, Japan.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBut opera is only one page of the Bayrakdarian résumé. An ever-active concertizer, she's appeared with the premier orchestras of New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Minnesota, Paris, London, Vienna, Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal under the baton of such eminent conductors as Seiji Ozawa, James Conlon, David Zinman, Michael Tilson Thomas, Alan Gilbert, Nicholas McGegan, Christoph von Dohnányi, Christoph Eschenbach, Colin Davis, Sir Andrew Davis, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Mariss Jansons, Leonard Slatkin, James Levine, Anne Manson, Bramwell Tovey, Peter Oundjian and Richard Bradshaw.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tHer versatility is also reflected in being the featured vocalist on the Grammy-award winning soundtrack of the blockbuster film <em>The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers</em>, and on the soundtrack of Atom Egoyan's Ararat; a trance music collaboration with electronica band \"Delerium\", which garnered yet another Grammy nomination, the BBC-produced short film \"HOLOCAUST – A Music Memorial Film from Auschwitz\", which generated close to a million views on Youtube, and her Gemini nominated film \"Long Journey Home\" documenting her first visit to her homeland Armenia. Additional interesting forays include her very successful tango album and project Tango Notturno, a recording of Armenian medieval sacred music in Joyous Light, and her recording of Seven Spanish Songs with the composer, Manuel de Falla \"accompanying\" her on the piano, made possible by Zenph Sound Innovations Inc.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBayrakdarian is the winner of four consecutive Juno Awards for Best Classical Album (Vocal)— for Azulão, a deft selection of Spanish, Brazilian, and Argentine songs, Cleopatra, baroque arias with Tafelmusik, a collection of songs by the great nineteenth-century singer/composer Pauline Viardot Garcia, and Mozart Arie e Duetti, a happy collaboration with two other famous Canadian singers, tenor Michael Schade and baritone Russell Braun. But her happiest collaborations, personal and professional, have involved the Armenian-Canadian pianist and composer Serouj Kradjian, her frequent accompanist and arranger and (not least) her husband and the father of their two young children. Their Nonesuch CD \"Gomidas Songs\" promoted and popularized the work of Armenian composer Gomidas Vartabed, earning them a Grammy nomination in 2009.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOther recordings with orchestra include Henryk Górecki's Symphony No. 3 with John Axelrod conducting the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, released on the Sony Classical label, and Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2 , alongside mezzo soprano Lorraine Hunt-Lieberson and Michael Tilson-Thomas conducting the San Francisco Symphony.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMs Bayrakdarian is the recipient of many awards, including the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee and the Diamond Jubilee Medals, the Arbor Award from the University of Toronto, the George London Foundation Award, and the Canada Council's Virginia Parker Prize.\n</p>",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tDramatic tenor Issachah Savage is garnering acclaim as a \"heldentenor par excellence\" with \"trumpet-like, clear, open-throated, powerful\" singing (<em>San Francisco Examiner</em>). Praised for his \"impressive natural instrument\" (<em>Opera News</em>), Mr. Savage is the winner of the 2014 Seattle International Wagner Competition earning the main prize, audience favorite prize, orchestra favorite prize, and a special honor by Speight Jenkins.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Savage makes his Metropolitan Opera debut as Don Riccardo in Verdi's <em>Ernani</em> under James Levine and covers Siegmund in <em>Die Walküre</em> at the Canadian Opera Company in the 2014 – 2015 season. He will debut with the Orchestre National de Bordeaux-Aquitaine under Paul Daniel in Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Santa Fe Symphony in Verdi's <em>Messa da Requiem</em>, and with the Seattle Youth Symphony in Mahler's <em>Das Lied von der Erde</em>. In the summer of 2014, he was heard in concert as Radames in Act 2 of <em>Aida</em> with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Tanglewood under Jacques Lacombe in his debut.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the 2013 – 2014, season, Issachah Savage made his Houston Grand Opera debut as Radames in <em>Aida</em> opposite Liudmyla Monastyrksa and Dolora Zajick, for which Opera Warhorses declared, \"The performances of Monastyrska and Savage were brilliant examples that Verdian voices continue to be produced.\" He was also seen in concert with the Washington Chorus at the Kennedy Center singing Act 2 of Verdi's <em>Aida</em>. In the summer of 2013, Mr. Savage participated in San Francisco Opera's Merola Program for gifted young singers singing the finale to Wagner's <em>Lohengrin</em> at the Merola Grand Finale concert. Writing of his performances of the last act of Otello in the Schwabacher Summer Concert series, the San Francisco Chronicle stated, \"From his opening notes - impeccably shaded and coiled with repressed fury - to the opera's final explosion of grief and shame, Savage sang with a combination of power and finesse that is rare to observe.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRecent performances for the dramatic tenor include the world premiere of Wynton Marsalis's <em>All Rise</em> with Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic, the world premiere of Leslie Savoy Burr's<em> Egypt's Night</em> with Philadelphia's Opera North, with Marin Alsop and the Baltimore Symphony in Gershwin's Blue Monday, and with the Opera Orchestra of New York alongside Elina Garanca in Massenet's <em>La Navarraise</em>. He also made his role debut as Radames in <em>Aida</em> at North Carolina Opera.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWith a sound that shines in Verdi and Wagner, Mr. Savage has participated in a number of programs designed for young artists with powerful voices including Evelyn Lear and Thomas Stewart Emerging Singers Program, Dolora Zajick's Institute for Young Dramatic Voices where he performed scenes from <em>Otello</em> and ACMA's Wagner Theater program where he performed scenes from <em>Die Walküre</em>, <em>Parsifal</em> and <em>Samson et Dalila</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAcclaimed for a voice with both dramatic and lyrical qualities, Mr. Savage excels on the concert stage and has performed with many notable conductors and ensembles. In addition to those mentioned above, he has performed Verdi's Messa da Requiem with the Flint Symphony Orchestra, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and Rossini's <em>Petite Messe Solennelle</em> with the New Dominion Chorale, Mendelsohn's <em>Elijah</em> with One Voice Chorale and Puccini's <em>Messa di Gloria</em> with Morgan State University.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to his 2012 grand prize with the Marcello Giordani International Competition, Issachah has received a number of prestigious awards, recognition and career grants from institutions such as Wagner Societies of New York, Washington, D. C., and Northern California, Licia Albanese International Puccini Foundation, Olga Forrai Foundation, Gerda Lissner Foundation, Jensen Vocal Competition, Opera Index, and Giulio Gari Foundation. The tenor's special talents were recognized early on by the Marian Anderson Society of Philadelphia, where he honored as its very first Scholar Artist and then again in 2009 as a prize winner in their Classical Icon competition. He has received two first places prizes in the esteemed Liederkranz Foundation competition, most recently in the 2012 Wagner Division and for General Opera in 2009.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBorn into a musical and religious family in the Philadelphia area, Issachah vividly remembers his first public performance – in church at age 5. A last minute decision to audition for CAPA secured him a place at the school and it was CAPA's choral director, David King, who first introduced him to opera through a recording of Jussi Björling singing \"Ingemisco\" from Verdi's <em>Requiem</em>. Mr. King went on to serve as an important mentor, encouraging the young artist to undertake rigorous vocal study and seriously consider a career as a professional singer. He possesses a Bachelor's Degree in Vocal Performance from Morgan State University and a Master's Degree in Opera Voice Performance from The Catholic University of America.\n</p>",

Her signature parts include the <em>bel canto </em>roles of Rossini, leading the <em>Financial Times </em>to declare her Elena <em>La Donna del Lago</em>, 'simply the best singing I've heard in years'.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMuch in demand on the concert and recital circuit, DiDonato holds residencies this season at both the Carnegie Hall, New York and the Barbican Centre, London. Recently she completed an acclaimed recital tour of South America, and has appeared in concert and recital in Berlin, Vienna, Milan, Toulouse, Mexico City and Aspen, in addition to appearing as guest singer at the BBC's Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall, London.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn opera she appeared last season as <em>Cendrillon </em>at the Liceu Barcelona, Sesto <em>La Clemenza di Tito </em>at the Lyric Opera Chicago, Angelina <em>La Cenerentola </em>at the Metropolitan Opera, and the title role of Donizetti's <em>Maria Stuarda </em>at the Royal Opera House.

He also toured to Japan with the ROH Covent Garden as Lesaut in <i>Manon</i> and made his South American debut with the Rio di Janiero Orchestra.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tOther recent opera appearances include • The Traveller in Benjamin Britten's <i>Death in Venice</i> at the Theatre an der Wien in Vienna • Lescaut in the ROH Covent Garden production of <i>Manon</i> • Valentin in <i>Faust</i> at ROH Covent Garden • the title role of<i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i> at La Scala • at the Opéra national de Paris in <i>Iphegénie en Tauride</i>, Die Zauberflöte, <i>Cosi fan tutte, Faust, Pelléas et Mélisande</i> • <i>Eugene Onegin</i>with the San Francisco Opera • the title role in <i>Billy Budd</i>, as Prince Andrei in <i>War and Peace</i>, and as Enrico in <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i> with the Canadian Opera Company.

His interpretations of German Lieder have won him international acclaim - <i>\"A searching musician, Braun also has one of the world's most beautiful baritone voices. He brings a poet's soul and a young man's bewildered grief to Schubert's shattering cycle of solitude and loss.\" (New York Newsday).</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>RECORDINGS</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRussell's extensive discography includes the GRAMMY-nominated Mahler's <i>Das Lied von der Erde</i> (Dorian), his highly acclaimed and JUNO-nominated recording of Schubert's <i>Die Winterreise</i> with pianist Carolyn Maule and the 2007 JUNO-award-winning recording of Mozart arias with tenor Michael Schade and soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian, both on the CBC Records label. <i>Winterreise</i> quickly made its mark among a revered set of recordings of the famous song-cyle - <i>\"[it] goes up against this formidable competition [Fischer-Dieskau and Goerne], as well an estimable Winterreise by Braun's late father, Victor. Braun fils's effort emerges with considerable credit...a mellifluous, musical and strongly felt interpretation.\" (Opera News)</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWinner of the 2001 JUNO for <i>Apollo e Daphne</i> with Les Violons du Roy (Dorian), Russell has twice recorded <i>Dido &amp; Aeneas</i> (Telarc with the Boston Baroque; CBC Records with Taflemusik), the award-winning <i>Soirée Française</i> with tenor Michael Schade, <i>Le Souvenir,</i> a collection of Canadian songs, <i>Shattered Night, Shivering Stars</i>featuring the music of Canadian composer Alexina Louie and <i>Liebeslieder - Folksongs</i>with the Aldeburgh Connection.

Both his much-lauded portrayal of Chou En-lai in Adams's <i>Nixon in China</i> (Nonesuch) and his performance as Olivier in <i>Capriccio</i> (Decca) at the Metropolitan Opera were released on DVD as part of the company's Live-in-HD series. Also on DVD, he can be seen as Mercutio in the highly acclaimed Salzburg Festival production of <i>Romeo et Juliette</i> and heard in the Mark Morris dance adaptation of Dido and Aeneas. He is also featured in Alexina Louie's comic opera <i>Burnt Toast</i>, a series of eight 6-minute comic operas written by Dan Redican for television featuring many of Canada's brightest actors and the voices of some of its most famed opera stars.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRussell Braun makes his home near Toronto with his wife, pianist Carolyn Maule and their sons, Benjamin and Gabriel.\n</p>",

        "biography": "<p>\n\tI grew up in a family full of musicians and artists, and have been a singer ever since I can remember. My father, William (Bill) Richard Braun went to Opera School and subsequently sang many comprimario roles with the Canadian Opera Company, and his brother Victor was a world-renowned Baritone. My mother, Eleanor (Smith) Braun, was with the Hamilton Philharmonic, and subsequently the Niagara Symphony, as Principal Flute. How very fortunate, to have such musical roots. I would be remiss not to mention how much I admire my talented cousins, Russell and Adi Braun...I have big footsteps to follow.... and this feeds my desire to learn as much as I can and to improve more and more each year.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">The CCOC was where it all started; I still remember being part of the 1975 production of \"I Pagliacci\" with the Canadian Opera Company. It ignited a passion in me!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">My Choral background is steeped in Church Music, from Trinity United Church Choir (Lloyd Bradshaw, Toronto) to The Ridley Singers (Michael Tansley, St. Catharines), St Thomas Anglican Church Choir (David Marsden, St Catharines), Knox Presbyterian Church Choir (Ken Hutton, St Catharines), and most recently, 5 years in The Orpheus Choir of Toronto under the brilliant baton of Robert Cooper. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">A high school vocal music class with the wonderful Theresa (Monaghan) Pothier was a terrific learning ground, with two great opportunities to lead our Musicals as Yum-Yum in the Mikado and Nellie in South Pacific. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">From there I also participated with Garden City Productions, in \"Ragtime to Riches\" and \"Gershwin First Person\" with Tom Inglis and Ross Inglis on duelling pianos. These two shows were choreographed by the fantastic Diane Nyland-Proctor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">I have sung various Church Solos and weddings and would love to do more of this. In particular, I aspire to sing Oratorio works and to do some Lieder Recitals.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">2013 found me preparing for my first operatic lead role, as Frasquita in Toronto City Opera's February 2014 production of Carmen ~ it was a dream come true!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">All of this has lead to a recording session, 10 full hours resulting in 16 tracks that were surprising to me in their results! I would like to thank Peter Krochak for his beautiful piano accompaniment, always sensitive to timing and so very musical in his interpretation. Thanks also to Brahm Goldhamer who spent many hours with me preparing ~ as our Artistic Advisor!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">Recently I have sung my debut as a soloist in two Cantatas, appearing with Choralis Camerata in St. Catharines. The works, fittingly chosen for St. Cecilia's Day, were Britten's 'A Ceremony of Carols' and Bach's 'Wachet Auf'. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span class=\"s1\">I am on to the next thing, preparing for a role debut as Oscar in Verdi's 'Un Ballo in Maschera' with Opera by Request, followed by a role debut as Barbarina in Mozart's 'Le Nozze di Figaro', with Toronto Summer Opera Workshop!</span>\n</p>",

        "biography": "“Silvery”-voiced coloratura soprano Sharleen Joynt has been “sparking audience enthusiasm” with her “special and unexpected amber timbre”, “a vocal range that is second to none”, her “scintillating stage presence”, and her “love for taking risks”. \n\nSharleen’s 2013/14 Season will include rejoining the Metropolitan Opera roster to cover Fiakermilli in R. Strauss’ Arabella. She will also appear with the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, Theater und Orchester Heidelberg, Theater St. Gallen in Switzerland, and make her France debut.\n\nFor the 2012/13 Season Sharleen spent her second year as an ensemble member of the Theater und Orchester Heidelberg, performing Blonde in Die Entführung aus dem Serail and receiving critical acclaim for her “stratospheric” Soprano 1/Ariadne in Wolfgang Rihm’s Dionysos. She also made both a role and house debut with the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe as Marie in La Fille du Régiment. Her uncommonly honest embodiment of characters and fearless onstage presence in German Regietheater led to a 3-page article in the May 2013 issue of Deutsche Bühne magazine.\n\nThe 2011/12 Season included joining the Theater und Orchester Heidelberg ensemble for Frasquita in Carmen and her vastly critically acclaimed Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos, the role for which she was nominated for Nachwunschsängerin (Young Singer of the Year) by Opernwelt magazine. She also debuted with the Winter in Schwetzingen Baroque Festival as Fausta in the German premiere of Scarlatti’s Marco Attilio Regolo.\n\nSharleen’s 2010/11 Season included joining the Metropolitan Opera roster to cover the role of Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos. She joined the Anhaltisches Theater Dessau ensemble, making her European debut as Oscar in Un Ballo in Maschera, followed by Adele in Die Fledermaus, and Despina in Cosi Fan Tutte. She also returned to the International Vocal Arts Institute in Tel Aviv to perform her frst Zerbinetta under the baton of Metropolitan Opera conductor Paul Nadler.\n\nIn 2009 Sharleen made her Carnegie Hall debut singing the soprano solo in Schubert’s Mass in G. For the 2009/10 Season she was an Emerging Artist with Calgary Opera. She graduated from Mannes College of Music in New York in 2009 with her Masters degree in Vocal Performance. She has been a prizewinner in the Liederkranz Foundation Competition, the George London Foundation Competition, the Young Concert Artists International Auditions, the Licia-Albanese Foundation Competition, the Canadian Music Competition’s International Stepping Stone, and the Palm Beach Opera Vocal Competition.",

        "biography": "Canadian soprano Teiya Kasahara has been praised as a “magnetic performer” singing with “a dynamic mix of sweetness undercut by strength” (Opera Canada). Her “impeccable” and “effortless” (reviewVancouver) signature role as the Queen of the Night has already hit Vancouver Opera, Highlands Opera Studio, Opera Kitchener, and next in Germany at the Aalto-Essen Theater, and later with Edmonton Opera. Teiya is a versatile artist in both the dramatic and lyric coloratura soprano repertoire with a soft spot for 20th/21st century music and theatre enjoying an ongoing collaboration with Tapestry Opera, where she portrayed the role of Hope in the Toronto premiere of Shelter (Palmer/\nSalverson) receiving only glowing reviews. Her triumph as Solana in the world premiere of Canada’s first lesbian opera *When the Sun Comes Out* (Leslie Uyeda/Rachel Rose) at the Queer Arts Festival led to two sold-out concert performances at the World Pride Festival in Toronto this past summer.\n\nMost recently Teiya has sung with Edmonton Opera as Olympia *The Tales of Hoffmann* and Toronto indie opera company Against the Grain Theatre in her highly acclaimed portrayal of Cherubino from *Figaro’s Wedding* praised for “singing clear, pure and straight from the heart.” (Opera Going Toronto). In September she will join Toronto indie opera\ncompany Opera 5 singing both soprano leads in the double-bill of Offenbach’s *Ba-ta-clan* and Reynaldo Hahn’s *L'île du rêve*.\n\nHer voice has taken her from the palm trees of the French Mediterranean (Opéra Toulon Provence Méditerranée) marking her European concert debut, to the glorious mountains of Aspen, Colorado where she performed Tytania\nfrom *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* under the baton of renowned conductor Jane Glover. In New York Teiya has performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) in Robert Lepage’s *The Nightingale & Other Short Fables* and in concert with Maureen Zoltek and Aaron Patterson *I Never Saw Another Butterfly* (versions by Ellwood Derr and Lori Laitman). In Toronto she has performed with the Off Centre Music Salon, the National Ballet of Canada, and the Concert Opera Group.\n\nTeiya has also performed extensively with the Canadian Opera Company (COC) as both an Ensemble Studio Artist from 2007-2010 and most recently as a guest artist. Her list of appearances at the COC include Echo in *Ariadne auf Naxos*, Lucy in *The Telephone*, Serpina L*a serva padrona*, Frasquita in *Carmen*, First Wood Sprite in *Rusalka*, the Balmont Fables The Nightingale & Other Short Fables (Stravinksy), Despina in *Così fan tutte*, and Maturina in *Don Giovanni* (Gazzaniga).\n\nAt the COC she has also had the privilege to understudy the title roles of Lucia di Lammermoor and Maria Stuarda, Zerbinetta in *Ariadne auf Naxos*, Madame Mao *Nixon in China*, Rosina in *Il barbiere di Siviglia*, Susanna and Barbarina in *Le nozze di Figaro*, Thibault in *Don Carlos*, Marzelline in *Fidelio*, Tytania in *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, Zerlina in *Don Giovanni*, Musetta in *La bohème*, Ilia in *Idomeneo* and the Nightingale in *The Nightingale & Other Short Fables*.\n\nAs a COC Ensemble Studio Artist Teiya performed in many diverse concerts from Messiæn to Schubert. In May of 2008 she co-wrote and performed a ground-breaking work commissioned by the COC and Royal Conservatory of Music for hiphop DJs and operatic voices entitled Deconstruction Reconstruction with DJ lil’ jaz and T.R.A.C.K.S. She also worked with a number of other great artists, directors, conductors, teachers and coaches including Tim Albery, Jane Archibald, Neil Armfield, Andreas Baesler, Dmitri Bertman, Laura Claycomb, Jonathan Darlington, Johannes Debus, Tom Diamond, Matthew Epstein, Paulo Gavanelli, Martin Isepp, Robert Lepage, Stephen Lord, Adrianne Pieczonka, Rory Macdonald, Marlena Malas, Catherine Malfitano, Lotfi Mansouri, Richard Margison, Gerald Martin Moore, Mary Morrison, Wendy Nielsen, Tim Noble, Liz Rowe, Gidon Saks, Margaret Singer and Ensemble Studio Director Liz Upchurch.\n\nShe has won awards from the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, including two finalist finishes in the Northwest Region in 2007 (4th Place) and 2011. She also has won 4th Place at the XI Czech and Slovak International Singing Competition in Montréal, and won 1st Place in her class at the Canadian Music Competition in 2012. Other honours she has received include the First Runner-Up and the Encouragement Award from the Northwest Regional Finals of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions (2007), the Johann Strauss Foundation Scholarship of UBC (2006), a partial career grant from the Vancouver Opera Guild (2009), and both scholarship and bursary from the Vancouver Women’s Musical Society (2007).\n\nAs a Wesbrook Scholar and the President of the Music Undergraduate Society of UBC, Teiya graduated in 2007 with a Bachelor of Music and the Catherine Cooke Topping Memorial Medal, distinguishing her as the top academic graduate of her class. From 2003-2007 she was a member of the UBC Opera Ensemble where she studied with Canadian lyric coloratura soprano Nancy Hermiston, O.C., Head of Voice and Opera and University Marshal at the University of British Columbia. While developing her skills as a coquettish soubrette (Adele in *Die Fledermaus*, Susanna/Barbarina *Le nozze di Figaro*, Gianetta in *The Gondoliers*, Musetta in *La bohème*) and interpreter of light lyric heroines (Romilda in *Xerxes*, Rosina in *Il barbiere di Siviglia*), Teiya also had the pleasure of performing the title role of Naomi in the Vancouver Opera’s new production of *Naomi’s Road* by Ramona Luengen, based on the children’s book by Joy Kogawa. During these formative years she had the pleasure of working with James Craig, Richard Epp, Bruce Pullan, Rena Sharon, Neil Varon, and participate in masterclasses and workshops with world-renowned artists such as Elly Ameling, Isabel Bayrakdarian, Bernarda Fink, Judith Forst, Margo Garrett, Karina Gauvin, Ben Heppner, Rudolf Jansen, Siegfried Jerusalem and Edith Mathis both at UBC and abroad.\n\nThough born in Ottawa, Teiya was raised on the west coast of BC. Along with her many musical endeavours she is a competitive soccer player, avid cyclist and photographer. Teiya currently resides in Toronto, Canada.

        "biography": "One of the most beloved and celebrated musical ambassadors of our time, soprano Renée Fleming captivates audiences with her sumptuous voice, consummate artistry, and compelling stage presence. At a White House ceremony in 2013, the President awarded her the National Medal of Arts, America's highest honor for an individual artist. Known as “the people’s diva” and winner of the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo, she continues to grace the world’s greatest opera stages and concert halls, now extending her reach to include other musical forms and media. Over the past few seasons, Renée has hosted a wide variety of television and radio broadcasts, including the Metropolitan Opera’s Live in HD series for movie theaters and television, and Live From Lincoln Center on PBS. She brought her voice to a vast new audience in 2014, as the first classical artist to sing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl.\n\nAs a musical statesman, Renée has been sought after on numerous distinguished occasions, from the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony to performances in Beijing during the 2008 Olympic Games. In 2012, in an historic first, she sang on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in the Diamond Jubilee Concert for HM Queen Elizabeth II. In January 2009, Renée was featured in the televised We Are One: The Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial concert for President Obama. She has also performed for the United States Supreme Court and, in November 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Czech Republic’s “Velvet Revolution” at the invitation of Václav Havel. An additional distinction was bestowed in 2008 when, breaking a precedent, Renée became the first woman in the 125-year history of the Metropolitan Opera to solo headline an opening night gala.\n\nRenée began 2014 at the Metropolitan Opera with her acclaimed portrayal of the title character in Dvorak's *Rusalka*, under the baton of Yannick Nézet-Séguin. In April, she sang the title role of Strauss's *Arabella* at the Salzburg Easter Festival, and May marked the Los Angeles Opera debut of Renée's Blanche in André Previn's *A Streetcar Named Desire*. In July, Renée made her debut as an actress in a non-musical play, in Living On Love at the Williamstown Theater Festival. In autumn of 2014, Renée was seen as Countess Madeleine in Strauss's *Capriccio* at Lyric Opera of Chicago, under the baton of Sir Andrew Davis, and with conductor Christian Thielemann at the Semperoper Dresden. On New Year's Eve she sang the title role in a new production of Lehar's *The Merry Widow* at the Metropolitan Opera.  \n\nRenée's recital schedule in recent years has spanned the globe, including Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Quito, Bogota,  Paris, Geneva, London, Vienna, Hong Kong, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Taipei. In 2013, she joined with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to present American Voices, a concert and 3-day festival celebrating the best American singing in all genres. The festival was the subject of a Great Performances documentary on PBS in January of 2015. Her 2014 recital calendar included performances in Tucson, Las Vegas, and Mesa, AZ. Concerts in 2014 included a duo evening with tenor Jonas Kaufmann at Lyric Opera of Chicago, another with tenor Michael Schade and the Dresden Philharmonic in Abu Dhabi, a concert at the New National Theatre in Tokyo, and Dresden concerts of Richard Strauss orchestral songs conducted by Christian Thielemann. \n\nA four-time Grammy winner, Renée won the 2013 Best Classical Vocal Solo Grammy Award for Poèmes (Decca, 2012), a collection of 20th-Century French music, including works composed especially for her by Henri Dutilleux. Her first-ever holiday album, Christmas in New York, was released by Decca in October of 2014.  In June 2010, Decca and Mercury records released the CD Dark Hope, which features Renée covering songs by indie-rock and pop artists. Her recent opera dvds include Strauss's *Arabella* and *Ariadne auf Naxos*, and Donizetti's *Lucrezia Borgia*. Other recent DVD releases include Handel's *Rodelinda*, Massenet’s *Thaïs* and Rossini’s *Armida*, all three in the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD series, and Verdi’s *Traviata*, filmed at London’s Royal Opera House. Ms. Fleming's 2010 DVD Renée Fleming & Dmitri Hvorostovsky: A Musical Odyssey in St. Petersburg follows Renée and baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky to Russia, where they explore and perform in some of St. Petersburg's most historic locations. In recent years, this fourteen-time Grammy nominated artist has recorded everything from Strauss’s complete *Daphne* to the jazz album Haunted Heart to the movie soundtrack of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*. She recorded Alexandre Desplat's theme song, \"Still Dream\" for the soundtrack of the Dreamworks Animation feature, Rise of the Guardians. Her recording honors range from the 2009 Echo Award for Strauss’s *Four Last Songs* to the Prix Maria Callas Orphée d’Or by the Académie du Disque Lyric for TDK’s DVD production of *Capriccio*. In February, 2012, Renée received the Victoire d’Honneur, the highest award conveyed by the French Victoires de la Musique.\n\nRenée Fleming’s artistry has been an inspiration to many other prominent artists, such as Chuck Close and Robert Wilson, whose portraits of her were included in the Metropolitan Opera’s 2007 fundraising auction. Two portraits of Ms. Fleming were also created by Francesco Clemente, who revealed one in Salzburg in spring 2007, with the Metropolitan Opera displaying the other in 2008. Photographic portraits include works by Brigitte Lacombe and Irving Penn, among others. In June of this year, the Annie Leibowitz portrait of Renée was added to the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC. \n\nRenée Fleming is a champion of new music and has performed works by a wide range of contemporary composers, including recent compositions by Anders Hillborg, Henri Dutilleux, Brad Mehldau, André Previn, and Wayne Shorter. Among her numerous awards are the Fulbright Lifetime Achievement Medal (2011); Sweden’s Polar Prize (2008); the Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur from the French government (2005); Honorary Membership in the Royal Academy of Music (2003); and honorary doctorates from Carnegie Mellon University (2012), the Eastman School of Music (2011) and The Juilliard School (2003), where she was also commencement speaker.\n\nAn advocate for literacy, Renée Fleming has been featured in promotional campaigns for the Association of American Publishers (Get Caught Reading), and the Magazine Publishers of America’s READ poster campaign for the American Library Association. She was honored by The New York Public Library as a “Library Lion.” Her book, The Inner Voice, was published by Viking Penguin in 2004, and released in paperback by Penguin the following year. An intimate account of her career and creative process, the book is also published in France by Fayard Editions, in the United Kingdom by Virgin Books, by Henschel Verlag in Germany, Shunjusha in Japan, and by Fantom Press in Russia.\n\nIn addition to her work on stage and in recordings, Renée Fleming has represented Rolex timepieces in print advertising since 2001. In 2008, she launched La Voce by Renée Fleming, a fragrance designed for her, with the proceeds benefiting the Metropolitan Opera. Master Chef Daniel Boulud created the dessert “La Diva Renée” (1999) in her honor, and she inspired the “Renée Fleming Iris” (2004), which has been replicated in porcelain by Boehm. Having been added to Mr. Blackwell’s best dressed list, her concert gowns have been designed by Reem Acra, Gianfranco Ferré, John Galliano for Dior, Douglas Hannant, Christian Lacroix, Oscar de la Renta, Angel Sanchez and Vivienne Westwood. In June of 2014, the Smithsonian added the gown designed by Vera Wang for Renée's Super Bowl anthem performance to the permanent collection of the Museum of American History. In addition to serving as the face of opera for two public transit campaigns in New York and London, Renée has appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman, The Martha Stewart Show, Spectacle: Elvis Costello with…, The View and Prairie Home Companion as “Renata Flambé,” among numerous other media outlets.\n\nRenée is currently a member of the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Hall Corporation, the Board of Sing for Hope, the Board of Trustees of Asia Society, and the Artistic Advisory Board of the Polyphony Foundation, which works to bridge the divide between Arab and Jewish communities in Israel by creating a common ground where young people come together around classical music. In 2010, she was named the first-ever Creative Consultant at Lyric Opera of Chicago, where she is also a member of the Board and a Vice President. She is currently curating the creation of a world-premiere opera based on the best-seller Bel Canto for Lyric Opera's 2015-2016 season.",

        "biography": "Soprano Sondra Radvanovsky is a globally celebrated artist. The sincerity and intensity that she brings to the stage as one of the most prominent sopranos of her generation have own her accolades from critics and loyalty from passionate fans. When the Washington Post praised her singing as \"outright gorgeous, poignant and silvery,\" it confirmed what Radvanovsky followers had known for years. The exquisite depth and color of her voice are matched by her artistry and versatility across a remarkable range of repertoire. Radvanovsky has earned praise for her riveting portrayal of the title role of *Rusalka* while her unique flexibility has led to success in such roles as Roxanne in *Cyrano de Bergerac* and the title role of *Lucrezia Borgia*. Her signature role is Leonora in *Il trovatore*, and she is widely regarded as one of the premiere Verdi sopranos alive today. She has portrayed the title role in *Aida*, Elvira in *Ernani*, the title role in *Luisa Miller*, Elene in *I vespri Siciliani*, Elisabeth de Valoi in *Don Carlo*, and Lina in *Stiffelio*, among others.\n\nDuring the 2014-15 season Radvanovsky will take on the title role in *Norma* at the San Francisco Opera, the Gran Teatre del Liceu, the Bayerische Staatsoper, and the Munich Festival. One of opera's most demanding roles, Norma has long been associated with some of the world's greatest sopranos. Radvanovsky made her *Norma* debut at Teatro Campoamor de Oviedo in the 2011-2012 season at the Metropolitan Opera. Radvanovsky will remain on the West Coast after her San Francisco *Norma* for her Los Angeles recital debut, the only recital at the Los Angeles Opera this seson. In December 2014 and January 2015, Radvanovsky will sing *Anna Bolena* at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, a company with which she has a close relationship. The role solidifies her amstery of what have come to be known as Donizetti's \"three queens\": the leading soprano roles in *Anna Bolena*, *Maria Stuarda*, and *Roberto Devereux*. Next seasons, Radvanovsky will perform all three queens at the Metropolitan Opera. March sees Radvanovsky singing concerts in Russia and performing the title role in *Aida* at the Wiener Staatsoper, while April sees her in New York reprising her role as Amelia in *Un ballo in maschera*.\n\n",

        "biography": "As the Associated Press observes, Stephen Costello is “a prodigiously gifted singer whose voice makes an immediate impact.” The Philadelphia-born tenor quickly established a reputation as a “first-class talent” (Opera News) after coming to national attention in 2007, when, aged 26, he made his Metropolitan Opera debut on the company’s season-opening night. Two years later Costello won the prestigious Richard Tucker Award, and has since appeared at many of the world’s most important opera houses and music festivals, including the Metropolitan Opera New York; Royal Opera House Covent Garden; Deutsche Oper Berlin; Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin; Vienna State Opera; Bayerische Staatsoper Munich and the Salzburg Festival. \n\nIn 2010 Costello created the role of Greenhorn (Ishmael) in the Dallas Opera’s world-premiere production of Jake Heggie and Gene Scheer’s *Moby-Dick*, prompting Opera magazine to hail him as “a tenor of ineffable sensitivity, with unfailing elegance in singing and a disconcerting ease in producing notes in head-voice.” Costello has since revised this role at San Francisco opera and Washington National Opera. Engagements in the 14-15 season and beyond include his return to the Metropolitan Opera, Covent Garden, Vienna State Opera, Canadian Opera Company, Houston Grand Opera, Deutsche Oper Berlin and Teatro Real Madrid.",

        "biography": "Susan Graham—dubbed “America’s favorite mezzo” by Gramophone magazine—rose to the highest echelon of international artists within just a few years of her professional debut, mastering an astonishing range of repertoire and genres along the way. Her operatic roles span four centuries, from Monteverdi’s Poppea to Sister Helen Prejean in Jake Heggie’s Dead Man Walking, which was written especially for her. Graham won a Grammy Award for her collection of Ives songs, and her recital repertoire is so broad that 14 composers from Purcell to Sondheim are represented on her most recent album, Virgins, Vixens & Viragos. Throughout her career, however, this distinctly American artist has been recognized as one of the foremost exponents of French vocal music; a Texas native, she was awarded the French government’s prestigious “Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur,” both for her popularity as a performer in France and in honor of her commitment to French music.\n\nThe mezzo’s earliest operatic successes were in such “trouser” roles as Cherubino in Mozart’s Le nozze di Figaro. Her technical expertise soon brought mastery of Mozart’s more virtuosic roles, like Sesto in La clemenza di Tito, Idamante in Idomeneo, and Cecilio in Lucio Silla, as well as the title roles of Handel’s Ariodante and Xerxes. She went on to triumph in the iconic Richard Strauss mezzo roles, Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier and the Composer in Ariadne auf Naxos. These brought Graham to prominence on all the world’s major opera stages, including the Metropolitan Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, San Francisco Opera, Covent Garden, Paris Opera, La Scala, Bavarian State Opera, Vienna State Opera, the Salzburg Festival, and many more. In addition to creating the role of Sister Helen Prejean in the world premiere production of Dead Man Walking at San Francisco Opera, Graham sang the leading ladies in the Met’s world premieres of John Harbison’s The Great Gatsby and Tobias Picker’s An American Tragedy, and made her Dallas Opera debut as Tina in a new production of The Aspern Papers by Dominick Argento. As Houston Grand Opera’s Lynn Wyatt Great Artist, she launched the past season as Prince Orlofsky in the company’s first staging of Die Fledermaus in 30 years, before heading an all-star cast as Sycorax in the Met’s Baroque pastiche, The Enchanted Island, and making her rapturously received musical theater debut in a new production of Rodgers & Hammerstein’s The King and I at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris.\n\nIt was in an early Lyon production of Berlioz’s Béatrice et Bénédict that Graham scored particular raves from the international press, and a triumph as Massenet’s Chérubin at Covent Garden sealed her operatic stardom. Further invitations to collaborate on French music were forthcoming from many of that repertoire’s preeminent conductors, including Sir Colin Davis, Charles Dutoit, James Levine, and Seiji Ozawa. New productions of Gluck’s Iphigénie en Tauride, Berlioz’s La damnation de Faust, and Massenet’s Werther were mounted for the mezzo in New York, London, Paris, Chicago, San Francisco, and elsewhere. She recently made title role debuts in Offenbach’s comic masterpieces La belle Hélène and The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein at Santa Fe Opera, and proved herself the standout star of the Met’s star-studded revival of Berlioz’s Les Troyens, which was broadcast live to cinema audiences worldwide in the company’s celebrated Live in HD series. This season, she returns to the Met in the title role of Susan Stroman’s new production of Lehar’s The Merry Widow, before closing the season opposite Bryan Hymel in a new staging of Les Troyens at San Francisco Opera. She also looks forward to headlining gala concerts at Los Angeles Opera and Lyric Opera of Chicago, where she joins Jane Lynch, Renée Fleming, Ramsey Lewis, and others to celebrate the latter company’s 60th anniversary.\n\nGraham’s affinity for French repertoire has not been limited to the opera stage, and serves as the foundation for her extensive concert and recital career. Such great oratorios and symphonic song cycles as Berlioz’s La mort de Cléopâtre and Les nuits d'été, Ravel’s Shéhérazade, and Chausson’s Poème de l’amour et de la mer take her to the world’s leading orchestras, with regular appearances at the New York Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, Orchestre de Paris, and London Symphony. Last season, she joined Bernard Haitink and the Boston Symphony for Shéhérazade in Boston and at Carnegie Hall, and in 2014-15 she sings Berlioz with the Royal Flemish Philharmonic for La mort de Cléopâtre, and undertakes Les nuits d'été with both the London Symphony Orchestra and John Eliot Gardiner’s Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique. Marking her first duo recital tour, the mezzo recently teamed up with soprano Renée Fleming at venues including Disney and Carnegie Hall. This season, she reunites with regular recital partner Malcolm Martineau for a West Coast tour and a season-closing recital in Classical Action’s Michael Palm Series.\n\nGraham’s distinguished discography features all the works described above, as well as solo albums including Un frisson francais, a program of French song recorded with pianist Malcolm Martineau for Onyx; C’est ça la vie, c’est ça l’amour!, an album of 20th-century operetta rarities on Erato; and La belle époque, an award-winning collection of songs by Reynaldo Hahn with pianist Roger Vignoles, from Sony. Among the mezzo’s additional honors are Musical America’s Vocalist of the Year and an Opera News Award.",

        "biography": "Praised for her rich voice, expansive range and appealing stage presence, Irish-born mezzo-soprano Tara Erraught has been called “a true rising star” by the press. Her international stature has continued to grow since she stepped in on five-days’ notice to sing the role of Romeo in Bellini’s I Capuleti e i Montecchi at the Bayerische Staatsoper in 2011, her performance winning worldwide acclaim. In the seasons since, she has sung a world premiere, made numerous role debuts, and successfully toured North America twice.\n\nMs. Erraught’s 2014 - 2015 season features performances in Germany, Ireland, Latin America, and the United States. With the Bayerische Staatsoper, she makes role debuts as Carlotta in Strauss’s Die Schweigsame Frau, Op. 80, Christa in Janáček’s The Makropulos Affair, Despina in Mozart’s Così fan tutte, in Humperdinck’s Hänsel und Gretel, as well as the role of Zweite Dame in Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte. She also debuts with the Santo Domingo Festival in the Dominican Republic. With the Hamburg Staatsoper, she sings Rosina in Rossini’s Il Barbiere di Siviglia and Angelina in La Cenerentola. She travels home to Ireland in spring 2015 to sing with the RTE National Symphony Orchestra, and then to the United States for her company debut with the Washington National Opera in its season concluding production of La Cenerentola.\n\nPast highlights include: creating the role of Kitty in the world premiere of Iain Bell’s A Harlot’s Progress at Theater an der Wien; role debuts as Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier at Glyndebourne Festival Opera, Sesto in La Clemenza di Tito, Nicklausse/The Muse in Les Contes d’Hoffmann, Prince Orlovsky in Die Fledermaus, Cherubino in Le Nozze di Figaro and singing in a new production of Hänsel und Gretel with the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich.  With the Wiener Staatsoper she sang Rosina in Il Barbiere di Siviglia, as well as the premiere performances of a new production of La Cenerentola, earning accolades from the press as the “New Queen of Belcanto”. In February 2011, Ms. Erraught came to worldwide attention, replacing an ailing colleague and learning the role of Romeo in five days for a new production of Bellini’s I Capuleti e i Montecchi.  This was after singing the title role of a new production of Ravel’s L’Enfant et les Sortilèges with Bayerische Staatsoper earlier that month. In summer 2010 she joined internationally celebrated French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet for the Prinsengracht-concert telecast from the canals of Amsterdam and made her Glyndebourne debut.\n\nIn spring 2013, the Bavarian government bestowed upon Ms. Erraught the prestigious Pro meritis scientiae et litterarum in recognition for outstanding contribution to the arts. She is only the fifth musician, and the youngest recipient, to be honored with the annual award since its inception in 2000.\n\nA native of Dundalk, Ireland, Tara Erraught has been a member of the opera studio at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich since 2008. In March of 2010 she was the recipient of Dublin’s National Concert Hall's Rising Star Award.

In that same year she was awarded both the Houston Grand Opera Prize and the Washington National Opera Prize at the International Hans Gabor Belvedere Singing Competition in Vienna. In 2007 Ms. Erraught won Dermott Troy Award for the Best Irish Singer.\n\nA graduate of the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Dublin, Ms. Erraught considers herself fortunate to continue her studies with the acclaimed Royal Opera soprano Veronica Dunne, who has been the guiding force in her musical career. In Munich, where she makes her home, she has the privilege to work with famed German mezzo-soprano Brigitte Fassbaender on her current repertoire.",

Gubanova was born in Moscow and began her musical studies as a pianist. An honorary graduate in choral conducting, Ekaterina studied opera singing at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatoire and the Sibelius Academy  (Helsinki) before becoming a member of the Young Artists programme at the Royal Opera House in London.\n\nIn 2005 she sang as Brangäne in Tristan und Isolde at the Opéra National de Paris to tremendous critical acclaim. She has since reprised the role in Baden-Baden, Rotterdam, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, St.  Petersburg and Munich, collaborating with such conductors as Daniel Barenboim, Valery Gergiev, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Semyon Bychkov and Kent Nagano. She has sung as Fricka in both Das Rheingold and Die Walküre under Daniel Barenboim at the Berliner Staatsoper and the Teatro alla Scala.\n\nHer Japanese debut came with a performance in Verdi’s Requiem in Tokyo conducted by Riccardo Muti. With Muti, Ekaterina made her Italian debut as Clitemnestre in Iphigénie en Aulide at the Opera di Roma.\n\nIn Russia, she has sung as Princess Eboli in *Don Carlo* at the Stars of the White Nights festival in St. Petersburg, where she later returned as Lyubasha in Rimsky-Korsakov’s *The Tsar’s Bride* and as Marguerite in Berlioz’ *La Damnation de Faust*. In 2007 she sang as Olga at the Salzburg Festival in a new production of *Eugene Onegin* conducted by Daniel Barenboim.\n\nFollowing her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in Prokofiev’s *War and Peace*, she began a fruitful collaboration with that theatre, singing as Giulietta in a new production of *Les Contes d’Hoffmann* under James Levine, Eboli in *Don Carlo* during the 2011 tour of Japan and Giovanna Seymour in *Anna Bolena* – the opening production of the 2011-2012 season. In the 2009 season she made her debut as Amneris in *Aida* at the Bayerische Staatsoper under Daniele Gatti and later under Daniel Barenboim for the Teatro alla Scala’s tour to Japan and Israel. Gubanova also sang the role in the 2011 season at the Chorégies d’Orange, receiving standing ovations from the public and rave reviews from the press.\n\nIn concert, she has sung the role of Jocasta in *Oedipus Rex* in London and Stockholm under Esa-Pekka Salonen. Gubanova has also been invited to perform Mahler’s *Das Lied von der Erde* in Paris, Moscow, Seoul and Dublin; she has also sung the composer’s *Rückert-Lieder* in Wiesbaden. She returned to Rotterdam to sing *Das Lied von der Erde* at the opening of the 2008 festival, while at the 2009 festival she presented songs from *Des Knaben Wunderhorn*. She also performed this work with the Sydney Opera and at the BBC Proms under Mark Elder. She sang Verdi’s *Requiem* under the baton of Daniel Barenboim with both the Teatro alla Scala and the Berliner Staatsoper as well as with Gustavo Dudamel in Los Angeles.\n\nRecent engagements include Rossini’s *Stabat Mater* in Vienna, *The Tsar’s Bride* at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, *Oberto*, Conte di San Bonifacio at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, *Les Contes d’Hoffmann* at the Teatro alla Scala and revivals of *Anna Bolena* at the Metropolitan Opera, *Tristan und Isolde* at the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía in Valencia and *Don Carlo* at the Berliner Staatsoper.\n\nPlans for future seasons include *Don Carlo* at the Teatro alla Scala, the Metropolitan Opera and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, *Adriana Lecouvreur* in London, *Tristan und Isolde* in Munich and Madrid, Wagner’s *Der Ring des Nibelungen* at the Teatro alla Scala and in Berlin, *Aida* at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and *Norma* in Barcelona.",

She has performed in Canada, the United States, Denmark, Latvia, Norway, and Austria.\n\nSince 2006, Sandra has specialized in the music of Edvard Grieg, and has recorded three albums of Grieg piano music on the Chestnut Hall Music label. A double album of two more recordings (Volumes 4 & 5) is planned for 2015, as well as a recording of Grieg songs with Norwegian soprano, Hilde Haraldsen Sveen.

Her specialties and interests also include 20th and 21st century opera, operatic and oratorio recitative, and recital repertoire and planning. A versatile musician, Sandra has extensive experience with opera, art song, chamber music, musical theatre, sacred and choral repertoire.\n\nSandra was awarded grants from the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Canada, the Association for the Advancement of Scandinavian Studies in Canada, and the Ontario Arts Council, for a 2014 research trip in to study Norwegian diction and Grieg’s songs for voice and piano.

        "biography": "Since his sensational début at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in a performance of “La Traviata” in 2006, Jonas Kaufmann has numbered among the top stars on the operatic horizon. The international press has singled him out as the “new king of tenors”. Insiders praise him as the most important German tenor since Fritz Wunderlich.\n\nJonas Kaufmann comes from Munich. He completed his vocal studies there at the local Music Academy, in addition to which he attended master classes with Hans Hotter, James King and Josef Metternich. During his first  years on stage at the State Theatre in Saarbrücken he continued his training with Michael Rhodes in Trier.\n\nAfter engagements in Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Milan - in Giorgio Strehler’s production of “Così fan tutte” and “Fidelio” with Riccardo Muti on the podium - Kaufmann moved on to the Zurich Opera in 2001. From there he began his international career. Appearances at the Salzburg Festival and the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Paris Opéra and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in London, La Scala Milan, the Deutsche Oper and the State Opera in Berlin, the Vienna State Opera and the Metropolitan in New York. In 2010 he made his début at the Bayreuth Festival as Lohengrin in a spectacular staging by Hans Neuenfels.\n\nKaufmann is just as much in demand internationally in the Italian and French repertoires as he is in German opera. He has sung Massenet’s Werther in Paris and Vienna, Cavaradossi in Puccini’s “Tosca” in London, at the Met and La Scala. His intensive characterizations of Don José in Bizet’s “Carmen”  and Werther in Massenet’s opera took opera fans throughout the world by storm. Kaufmann loves portraying shattered characters, immersing himself in their world and making their thoughts and emotions strikingly believable.\n\nBesides his vocal and musical qualities, it is his total identification with his roles that has been received with such enthusiasm by press and public. This was the case at his role début as Siegmund in “Die Walküre” at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in the spring of 2011. The eagerly awaited new production, masterfully conducted by James Levine, and transmitted world-wide on radio and in HD to cinemas, allowed audiences to hear the special quality of Kaufmann’s Wagner interpretations in detail: The blend of “German” expressive power and Italian vocal finesse. When Kaufmann afterwards had such a great success performing the title role of Gounod’s “Faust” (a new production that could also be seen in cinemas all over the world) he showed once again his vocal and theatrical versatility.\n\nOn his home turf in Munich, Kaufmann has thus far been heard as Tamino, Lohengrin, Don José, Cavaradossi, Florestan in “Fidelio” and Don Carlo. In 2012 he gave his debut as Bacchus in “Ariadne auf Naxos” by Richard Strauss at the Salzburg Festival. In Salzburg he was also heard as Don José in the new production of “Carmen” conducted by Simon Rattle and in a performance of the Verdi Requiem conducted by Daniel Barenboim, which has been also performed at La Scala and at the Lucerne Festival. In December 2012 he came back to Milan for the opening of La Scala’s new season with the new production of “Lohengrin”, conducted by Barenboim and directed by Claus Guth. \n\n2013 was the year of Wagner and Verdi: After the Met’s new production of “Parsifal” and the revival of “Don Carlo” at the ROH in London, Kaufmann portrayed the title role in “Don Carlo” also in Munich and Salzburg. Furthermore he undertook two Verdi roles for the first time: Manrico in “Il Trovatore” and Alvaro in “La Forza del Destino”, both in new productions at the Bayerische Staatsoper. In February and March 2014 he portrayed Massenet’s Werther in a new production at the Met, in June he gave his debut as Des Grieux in Puccini’s “Manon Lescaut” at the ROH in London. \nRecent highlights of his career were his debut as Andrea Chenier in a new production at the ROH with Antonio Pappano conducting, his first Radames in Rom (in a concert performance with Anja Harteros and Pappano) and a high acclaimed double debut in the new production of “Cavalleria rusticana / Pagliacci” at the Salzburg Easter Festival. After the big success of his solo album with evergreens from the late Twenties and early Thirties (“Du bist die Welt für mich”) he made a concert tour with those popular tunes of Lehár, Kálmán, Stolz, Tauber and others.\n\nKaufmann's versatility is documented on a number of CD’s and DVD’s in performances of such works as “Lohengrin”, “Walküre”, “Parsifal”, “Königskinder”, “Ariadne auf Naxos”, “Don Carlo”, “Tosca”, “Adriana Lecouvreur”, “Werther” and “Carmen”. His solo albums “Verismo”,  “Wagner” and “Verdi” were bestsellers only a few weeks after being released. In 2011 he was presented the coveted “Opera News Award” in New York. An article in “Opera News” heralded this selection with the words: “His intensity and elegance, the smoothness of his voice and his body language, combined with his musicality and his glowing appearance make him the very definition of a 21st century opera star.” Shortly afterwards Kaufmann was named a “Chevalier de l’Orde de l’Art et des Lettres” by French culture minister Frédéric Mitterand. Kaufmann has been selected several times as “Singer of the Year”, by the classical music magazines “Opernwelt”, “Diapason” and “Musical America” as well as by the juries of “Echo-Klassik” and the inaugural “International Opera Awards” (London 2013). \n\nKaufmann is also a familiar figure world-wide on the concert and recital platforms. He regards art song interpretation as “The Royal Class of Singing”. since this genre calls for considerably more finesse and differentiation than any other vocal discipline. His partnership with pianist Hemut Deutsch, with whom he worked as far back as his student days in Munich, has proven itself in countless concerts including one on October 30 2011, on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera in New York. This was the first solo recital given at the Met since Luciano Pavarotti’s back in 1994.\n",

        "biography": "She has been called the \"Star Spangled Singer\" and \"the Heifetz of singers.\" In 2002, after a career in which for over four decades Marilyn Horne had dominated her field, Opera News said, “Marilyn Horne – whose face and song have been in the light – in so many places, in so many styles, through so many media, for so many years – may be the most influential singer in American history.”  \n\nMarilyn Horne continues to be one of America’s most beloved artists.  She has received numerous accolades and honors in the arts as well as academia.  Miss Horne was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in October 2009 and the next month was honored in Washington, DC as the 2009 recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Opera Honors.  President Clinton named her a Kennedy Center Honoree in 1995.  In 1992, she received the National Medal of the Arts from President Bush and the Endowment for the Arts.  Miss Horne sang at the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton White Houses and at President Clinton’s inauguration in 1993.  In October of 2000, Miss Horne returned to the town of her birth, Bradford, Pennsylvania, where a street on the public square was named in her honor.  On that occasion, she also presented the opening season gala for the Bradford Creative and Performing Arts Center, where she was presented with the Presidential Medal of Distinction from the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford.  \n\nNow holding her sixteenth year of residency at the University of Oklahoma (Norman), her ninth with the Oberlin Conservatory Marilyn has given master classes for five years at the University of Maryland (College Park), has recently offered first time master classes at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, Maryland, at St. Joseph’s College in West Hartford, Connecticut and was part of the inaugural season of a new master class program, Lieder Alive! at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.\n\nRecent and very special milestones and achievements for Marilyn Horne include being a recipient of the prestigious Opera News Award, the highest honor given within the opera industry, to recognize distinguished contributions from leading figures in the world of opera. In January of 2009 she celebrated her 75th Birthday and the 15th Anniversary of the founding of the Marilyn Horne Foundation with a star-studded Gala concert at Carnegie Hall.  \n\nAmong Marilyn Horne's many worldwide prizes are the Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters from France's Ministry of Culture, the Commendatore al Merito della Repubblica Italiana, the Fidelio Gold Medal from the International Association of Opera Directors, and the Covent Garden Silver Medal for Outstanding Service.  Miss Horne's international success in the most difficult of coloratura mezzo-soprano roles led to the revival of many of Rossini’s and Handel's greatest operas.  In an unprecedented move, Marilyn Horne received Italy’s first Rossini Medaglia d’Oro, created especially for her.\n\nMiss Horne celebrated twenty-six years as a leading lady at the Metropolitan Opera, and was honored at the San Francisco Opera for her thirty-nine seasons there in October 1999.  Her many academic awards include numerous honorary doctorates from schools including the Juilliard School, Johns Hopkins University and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.  In 1999, Miss Horne was inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame.  In 2001, Miss Horne received a President’s Merit Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame.\n\nGrammy Awards have been presented to Miss Horne for several of her operatic recordings.  These include Handel's *Semele* (Deutsche Grammaphon), *Presenting Marilyn Horne*, *In Concert at the Met with Leontyne Price and Marilyn Horne*, and *Carmen* (conducted by Leonard Bernstein).  In April, 2008, Decca released an 11 CD set entitled *Marilyn Horne, The Complete Decca Recitals*, as well as re-released *Souvenir of a Golden Era* to highlight Miss Horne’s appearance as Host/Narrator for the North American premiere of “Pauline Viardot and Friends,” under the auspices of San Francisco presents, also starring Frederica Von Stade and Vladimir Chernov. Additional releases include a collection of songs of Bernstein, Barber and Bolcom, entitled *I Will Breathe a Mountain*, on BMG and a recording of the songs of Irving Berlin that was released by VAI in 2000. In 2005, BMG-Sony re-released two of Miss Horne’s CDs – *Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir* and *All Through the Night*, a collection of the world’s most beloved lullabies for children. A two CD compilation entitled *Just for the Record – The Golden Voice of Marilyn Horne*, from Universal Classics, was released for Miss Horne’s 70th birthday celebration in 2004. Also released for this occasion, was Miss Horne’s updated autobiography, *The Song Continues*, written with Jane Scovell from Baskerville Press.\n\nIn celebration of her 60th birthday in January of 1994, Miss Horne launched The Marilyn Horne Foundation, dedicated to the art of the vocal recital and presentation of young singers in recital throughout the United States.  In its 16 years, the Foundation introduced over 30,000 students to the vocal recital and classical song through more than 300 education programs across the country, along with full recital appearances in New York City and many cities throughout the nation. In July 2010 the Foundation’s programs became part of the venerable Carnegie Hall. Miss Horne remains Artistic Advisor to her song programs, now The Marilyn Horne Legacy at Carnegie Hall, where, in keeping with the January tradition of Miss Horne’s birthday, a week of recitals and master classes are offered by artists such as Maestro James Levine, Christa Ludwig, Grace Bumbry, Thomas Hampson, Regine Crespin, Warren Jones, Brian Zeger and Martin Katz.\n\nMarilyn Horne is on the faculty at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California.  As Vocal Program Director, she teaches public master classes and private lessons to some of the world's most promising young artists.  Miss Horne has been responsible for reviving full length staged opera performances at the Academy with brand new productions of Rossini's *Il Viaggio a Reims* - a smashing success - and Mozart's *Die Zauberflöte* in 1997 and 1998, followed by Handel's rarely performed opera, *Rodelinda* in the summer of 1999, Richard Strauss’s masterpiece, *Ariadne auf Naxos* in the summer of 2000, and Donizetti’s *Don Pasquale* and Debussy’s *Pelléas and Mélisande* (the Peter Brook, 90-minute, two piano version) in 2001.  Productions of Benjamin Britten’s opera *Albert Herring* and Mozart’s great masterpiece, *Le Nozze di Figaro* followed respectively in 2002 and 2003. 2004 brought Nino Rota’s *Il Cappello di Paglia di Firenze*, and Mozart’s classic *Cosi fan Tutte* was presented in 2005.  Rossini’s *Il Viaggio a Reims* made its second appearance in 2006 and Puccini’s *La Bohème* made its Music Academy debut in 2007.  William Bolcom’s *The Wedding*, received high acclaim as the 2008 production and in 2009, Thomas’ *Mignon* received a rare and highly anticipated staging. She since has followed up with the staging of Mozart’s *Don Giovanni* in 2010, Rossini’s *Barber of Seville* in 2011, Stravinsky’s interpretative *The Rake’s Progress* in 2012, a return of *Die Zauberflöte* in 2013, and a production of *Carmen* in 2014, set in Santa Barbara’s own surrounding mountains circa 1850, and heralded as ‘persuasive’ by Opera News magazine. \n\nBorn in Bradford, Pennsylvania, Marilyn Horne began her musical studies with her father and first sang in public at the age of two.  When she was eleven, her family moved to Long Beach, California.  After completing high school at Long Beach Polytechnic, she studied voice with William Vennard and song/recital works with Gwendolyn Koldofsky (her accompanist thereafter for ten years) at the University of Southern California.  During that time, she also participated in master classes with Lotte Lehmann at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara and Cal Tech in Pasadena.  At the age of twenty, she made her operatic debut with the Los Angeles Guild Opera and, at that same age, dubbed the voice of Carmen in the highly successful film of *Carmen Jones* starring Dorothy Dandridge as Carmen.  Her early operatic career included three years at the Gelsenkirchen Municipal Opera, Germany where she sang a wide variety of starring roles.  In 1960, she returned to the U.S. where she presented her sensational debut in Berg's Wozzeck with the San Francisco Opera Company, followed by her Lyric Opera of Chicago debut in 1961. In September of 1999, Miss Horne fulfilled a personal goal of singing in all fifty states with an engagement in Laramie, Wyoming. \n\nIn the year 2000, Marilyn Horne stopped programming classical repertoire in recital, and began to offer programs that reflect her deep and abiding interest and experience, since childhood, in American folk and popular songs.  In collaboration with Tony Award winning pianist, arranger, and conductor Don Pippin, she presents to this day *An Evening of Great American Popular Songs*, which debuted in 2000 at the Bradford Creative and Performing Arts Center. Additional programs in recent years have included *Steppin’ Out with Irving Berlin*, with tenor Robert White and pianist Dick Hyman, which opened the concert series of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City in October 2000 and Stephen Foster: Songs of America, which debuted with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra for the 2002-03 opening season gala.  Just Between Friends with Barbara Cook, which debuted in spring of 2002 at the Wharton Center, in East Lansing, MI, continues to receive rave reviews, with performances at Symphony Hall, Boston, The Kravis Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, Lehigh University’s Zoellner Arts Center, Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center in College Park, MD, and, most recently, in May 2008 at the Granada Theatre in Santa Barbara, CA. \n\nActively dedicated to excellence in vocal art, Miss Horne has ongoing commitments for private teaching and master classes throughout the world - well into the next decade.\n",

        "biography": "Years ago, a fan suggested that Plácido Domingo (whose name literally translates as “Placid Sunday”) should use the saying “If I rest, I rust™” as a motto. In fact, Domingo has been incessantly active since the age of sixteen ― and the more he has studied, travelled and performed, the more he has felt fulfilled and the deeper his love of music has become. \n\nDomingo has been at home on the world’s stages for over half a century: as of the end of 2013, he had sung 3,687 performances of 144 roles, in addition to having conducted 526 performances and made numerous recordings. Few if any performers have ever been able to look back on such a successful and well-documented career – and at the age of seventy-two, he forges ahead with total, unabated commitment.\n\nDomingo’s charm and the extraordinary kindness that he demonstrates towards everyone with whom he comes in contact enthrall thousands year after year. His voice’s exceptionally warm timbre and equally exceptional flexibility combine with his remarkable acting talent and give him what he thinks of as a great opportunity to give pleasure to people throughout the world. \n\nPlácido Domingo Embil was born in Madrid on 21 January 1941. His father, Plácido Domingo, Sr., and his mother, Pepita Embil, were celebrated performers of zarzuela, the Spanish form of operetta, which Plácido Domingo loves to this day. In 1949 his parents established their own theatre company in Mexico, and the eight-year-old Plácido and his sister followed the parents there. Mexico City remained his home for thirteen years: he went to school there and was enthusiastic about football (soccer) and the corrida (bullfighting). Football has remained one of Domingo’s great passions, mainly as a spectator, although he has occasionally participated in benefit matches. \n\nHe received his first piano lessons when he was eight years old, and thanks to his parents’ ensemble he learned all the basics of musical theatre, including its harsh economic realities. Today, as general director of a major opera company, he looks back with gratitude on that time. \n\nAt the age of fourteen, Plácido was accepted at Mexico’s National Music Conservatory, but he soon faced major difficulties. He married when he was sixteen, and only a year later he became the father of a son, José. His first marriage did not last long, but these early responsibilities explain why he had to begin to work hard at so early an age. He took any job that came his way in the colourful world of music and the theatre. \n\nPlácido accompanied singers in classy and not-so-classy bars, sang in the musical *The Redhead*, played piano for a travelling ballet troupe, arranged his own music program with a new cultural radio station in Mexico City, accepted small acting roles in television productions of plays by Pirandello, Benavente, García Lorca and Chekhov and compiled background music for radio series. In addition, he trained choruses for zarzuelas and musicals, produced American pop music arrangements for Mexican recordings, and made himself available as a singer of background music. Each of these activities would prove to be of great benefit to him in one way or another later in his life.\n\nPlácido also accompanied his mother on the piano during her solo performances and took on smaller baritone roles in his parents’ company as well as a minor role in the first Mexican production of *My Fair Lady*, which was performed 185 times. And he appeared in 170 performances of *The Merry Widow*. \n\nNineteen-fifty-nine was a decisive year: Domingo, only eighteen years old, auditioned as a baritone for the Mexican National Opera. The committee liked his voice very much and the members also allowed him to audition with a tenor aria, which made him realize that he was really a tenor and not a baritone. He was initially engaged to sing small tenor parts, and he debuted that autumn as Borsa in Verdi’s *Rigoletto*. The first leading role followed only two years later, in Monterrey: Alfredo in *La Traviata*. \n\nAt first, however, he sang mainly minor roles, and in November 1961 he made his US debut in Dallas as Arturo in Donizetti’s *Lucia di Lammermoor*. The following year brought important changes: Plácido Domingo married the soprano Marta Ornelas, with whom he had become acquainted at the conservatory. Both moved to Tel Aviv, where they performed with the Hebrew National Opera for three seasons, learning a great deal in the process. At the same time, Marta and their friend Franco Iglesias – a Mexican baritone who also belonged to the ensemble – helped Plácido to overcome a few technical problems in his singing. \n\nThus the path for one of the greatest careers in the history of opera was paved. Upon the Domingos’ return from Israel, Marta gave up her singing career to devote herself entirely to raising their two sons (Plácido, Jr., was born in 1965 and Alvaro in 1968) and to her husband’s career. She remains his adviser to this day, and now that the children are grown up Domingo is proud of Marta for having regained a foothold in the opera world as a stage director.\n\nOnly six months after his departure from Tel Aviv, Domingo was called to New York: The New York City Opera wanted him for the world première of Alberto Ginastera’s Don Rodrigo, with which the ensemble opened its Lincoln Center residency at the New York State Theater (now David Koch Theater). \n\nThe breakthrough had been achieved, and Plácido Domingo received a wealth of engagements. In 1967 he debuted at the Hamburg State Opera in *Tosca* and at the Vienna State Opera in *Don Carlo*; in 1969 at the Verona Arena in *Turandot*, San Francisco Opera (*La Bohème*), and La Scala in Milan (*Ernani*); in 1970 in his native Madrid (*La Gioconda*) and at the Edinburgh Festival (Beethoven’s *Missa Solemnis*); in 1971 at London’s Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (*Tosca*); in 1972 at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich (*La Bohème*); in 1973 at the Paris Opéra (*Il Trovatore*); and in 1975 at the Salzburg Festival (*Don Carlo*). The audience at the Bayreuth Festival experienced Plácido Domingo for the first time in 1992 when he sang the title role in *Parsifal*. Numerous engagements since then have regularly brought this exceptional performer to virtually all of the world’s great opera houses.\n\nDomingo has neither a favorite opera role nor a favorite opera house, yet he has appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York more frequently than at any other theatre. He made his house debut in 1968 as Maurizio in Cilea’s *Adriana Lecouvreur*, and since then he has sung there every season. As of the end of 2012, he had sung over 800 performances with the company at home and on tour, in a total of 46 roles, and to date he has opened the Met’s season no fewer than twenty times, breaking the record set by Caruso. He has also conducted there many times – increasingly so in recent years.\n\nIn 1983, in the first edition of his memoirs (original title: *My First Forty Years*), Domingo defended himself against critics who had accused him of taking too many vocal risks by singing too much and singing roles that were not right for his voice. Of course, every singer has successful and less successful evenings. But Domingo – who can look back on many thousands of rehearsals and performances over nearly half a century, and at the highest artistic level – can assert with pride that his decisions were the right ones. His voice has endured in beautiful condition far beyond the average professional lifetime of most singers. He is justifiably proud of having been included in the Guinness Book of Records for the size of his repertoire but also for having received 101 curtain calls after his performance of Verdi’s *Otello* in Vienna. His interpretation of the jealous commander remains unequalled.\n\nHis repertoire extends from Rameau’s *Hippolyte et Aricie* (1733) to the world premieres of operas by Ginastera and Anton García Abril; the latter’s work, *Las Divinas Palabras*, inaugurated the restored Teatro Real in Madrid in October 1997. In September 2003, Domingo sang the role of Rasputin at the world premiere of Deborah Drattell’s opera *Nicholas and Alexandra* in Los Angeles, and in Vienna the following July he performed *Goya*, an opera written especially for him by Gian Carlo Menotti (first performance 1986, in Washington). In May 2005 he performed the title role in Alfano’s rarely revived *Cyrano de Bergerac* at the Met. Met audiences also saw him in the title role in the world premiere, in 2007, of *The First Emperor* by the Chinese composer Tan Dun, and in Los Angeles in 2010 Domingo created the role of Pablo Neruda in the world premiere of *Il Postino* by the Mexican composer Daniel Catán. In 2011 he was Neptune in the world premiere production of the Met’s Baroque pastiche opera, *The Enchanted Island*. But well-known works such as *Tosca*, *La Bohème* and *Carmen* have also accompanied Domingo on his path through life, and he has also enjoyed conducting many of these operas. He set a personal record in July 2003 in London when he sang the matinee performance of Leoncavallo’s *Pagliacci* and conducted the evening performance of the same opera. \n\nHis major new roles in recent years have included Siegmund in Wagner’s *Die Walküre* and the title part in the same composer’s *Parsifal*, as well as Gherman in Tchaikovsky’s *The Queen of Spades*. In 2007 Domingo devoted himself to important works of the baroque and early classical eras by giving his first performances as Oreste in Gluck’s *Iphigénie en Tauride* at the Seattle Opera as well as the Met and as Bajazet in Handel’s *Tamerlano* at the Washington National Opera. He has recently been adding several lyric baritone parts to his repertoire: in the course of the 2009-10 season he appeared in the title baritone role of Verdi’s great *Simon Boccanegra* at the Berlin Staatsoper, La Scala, the Metropolitan Ope*Rigoletto* in an on-location worldwide telecast in 2010; in 2012 he added the baritone roles of Athanaël in Massenet’s *Thaïs* and Francesco Foscari in Verdi’s *I Due Foscari*; and in 2013 he increased his baritone repertoire with four more major Verdi roles: Giorgio Germont in *La Traviata*, the title part in Verdi’s *Nabucco*, Giacomo in *Giovanna d’Arco*, and the Count di Luna in *Il Trovatore*.\n\nFostering the greatest masterpieces of world opera continues to remain Domingo’s foremost concern. As General Director of the Los Angeles Opera (and, until 2011, Washington National Opera), he presents not only classics by Mozart, Verdi, Puccini and others but also more unusual repertoire, including operas by contemporary American composers.\n\nSince 1993 Domingo has promoted highly talented young singers through the Operalia voice competition. Each year, in a different international city, forty pre-selected singers take part and have the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities before an international jury; the 2014 competition will be held in Los Angeles. In March 2002, the Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program – another of Domingo’s undertakings to nurture and give opportunities to promising young talents – came into being at the Washington National Opera, and the Domingo-Colburn-Stein Young Artist Program, subsequently founded under the auspices of Los Angeles Opera, has similar goals.\n\nPlácido Domingo has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the United States as well as the titles of Commandant of the Legion of Honor in France, Honorary Knight of the British Empire, and both Grande Ufficiale and Cavaliere di Gran Croce of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. He has received honorary doctorates from Oxford University and New York University for his lifelong commitment and contribution to music and the arts. In October 2009, King Carl Gustaf of Sweden presented him with the first Birgit Nilsson Prize (at one million dollars, the most generous prize in the world of classical music) for his outstanding achievements in opera; in accepting the award, Domingo said that it would “greatly benefit my annual competition, Operalia.” He has raised millions of dollars through benefit concerts to aid the victims of Mexico’s devastating 1985 earthquake, of the floods caused by Hurricane Paulina in Guerrero and Yucatán, also in Mexico and in El Salvador, and of the victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, where, in 2009, the stage of the Mahalia Jackson Theatre for the Performing Arts was named for him. In 2006, he conducted Verdi’s *Requiem Mass* in Warsaw, to commemorate the first anniversary of Pope John Paul II’s passing.\n\nDomingo has made more than 100 recordings; many of them are full-length operas, and some operas he has recorded more than once. He also has numerous solo and duet recordings to his credit. Many of his albums have sold over a million copies, and this achievement has garnered several gold and platinum records as well as twelve Grammy awards. In addition, he has made numerous opera videos and collaborated in three famous opera films: *La Traviata* and *Otello* under the direction of Franco Zeffirelli and *Carmen* directed by Francesco Rosi. Domingo was honored with Emmy awards for the television film “Hommage à Sevilla” and for the Met’s Silver Gala. \n\nDomingo’s strong bond with zarzuela aroused his desire to promote this magical form of Spanish operetta and make it more accessible to an international audience. He appeared in Federico Moreno Torroba’s *Luisa Fernanda* in Milan and Vienna, singing – like his father many years ago – the baritone role of Don Vidal. Luisa Fernanda was also performed by Washington National Opera in 2004, at the Teatro Real in Madrid in 2006 and by Los Angeles Opera in 2007.\n\nDomingo is also interested in light and popular music. In addition, his appearances around the world with his colleagues José Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti in the now legendary Three Tenors concerts were one of the great musical success stories of the 1990s. In August 2006, Domingo, soprano Anna Netrebko and tenor Rolando Villazón were acclaimed by thousands of spectators during a joint concert at Berlin’s outdoor Waldbühne, as were the two zarzuela evenings that he and Villazón presented at the 2007 Salzburg Festival.\n\nDomingo has enjoyed and continues to enjoy the privilege of working with the world’s most famous singers ― from those who were ending their careers when his was beginning to those who are starting out today. He also performs regularly with the most distinguished conductors and stage directors of our time; in particular, the collaboration with important conductors has increasingly strengthened his own work as an opera and concert conductor. For more than thirty years he has been seen on the podiums of most major opera houses, and in 2006 he conducted the opening performance of the newly restored Theater an der Wien, one of Vienna’s historic opera houses. Over time he has increasingly assumed responsibilities in the realm of musical administration, too: In 1992, he was artistic director of the World Exhibition in Seville; he is the former General Director of Washington National Opera; and he is currently General Director of Los Angeles Opera, which, under his guidance, has become one of America’s most significant opera ensembles. \n\nEven in a very brief overview of his extraordinarily busy life, Domingo does not fail to point out the most terrible incident for him: the 1985 earthquake in Mexico, in which four of his close relatives were killed. He was involved in on-the-scene rescue efforts, and since then he has helped to raise several million dollars for the victims. All in all, however, Plácido Domingo considers himself the happiest person he knows, since he has seen much of the world and has been able to give pleasure to millions through his art. He thinks of his talent and his voice as gifts to be shared, and this is why he is currently working on a book , The Joy of Opera, in which he will convey the greatness of the art he has so devotedly served throughout his long professional life.\n\nNewsweek and other international publications have fittingly described Plácido Domingo as “the King of Opera,” “a true renaissance man in music” and “the greatest operatic artist of modern times.”",

        "biography": "Janani Sridhar made headlines as the first ever Singaporean to win the first prize in the Vocal, Under 16 Category at the 58th Llangollen International Musical Eistedfodd. The competition, commonly billed as \"The Musical Olympics\" is held in Wales and had her competing against over 6,000 other global competitors. The jury described Janani as \"a gifted singer who has a marvelous future in singing.\"\n \nBorn in Singapore, Soprano Janani Sridhar is no stranger to the performing arts in her home country. She has performed with the Singapore Lyric Opera in Bizet's Carmen (2002), and in Puccini's Tosca (2003). She was also invited by them to sing in a concert of Jazz Opera Arias, and was accompanied by reknown pianist, Shane Thio. In 2008, Janani had the honor of singing the national anthem, \"Majulah Singapura\" at the internationally broadcast, first ever Formula One Grand Prix night race which was held in Singapore.\n \nJanani has also performed with the Singapore Chinese Orchestra in \"Adventures of The Monkey King,\" the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, as \"Knabe\" in Mendelssohn's *Elijah*, and in HSBC Youth Excellence Gala with Orchestra of the Music Makers.\n \nIn 2005, Janani was the very first singer to have received the HSBC Youth Excellence Award. She was awarded the honour by President S. R. Nathan, who frequents her performances. From her 2006 concert, \"Janani @ Esplanade,\" she helped to raise over $150,000 for The President's Star Charity. Janani was also flown home to sing the national anthem, “Majulah Singapore” during the internationally telecast, first ever night race of the Formula 1 Grand Prix in 2008.\n \nDuring her undergraduate years at The Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Janani  performed with the Oberlin Opera Theater (OOT)  in Massenet's *Cendrillion*, Smetana's *The Bartered Bride*, and Mozart's *La Clemenza di Tito*. She also performed in a variety of opera scenes with OOT. These scenes include the \nCountess in Mozart's *Le Nozze di Figaro*, Ännchenn in *Der Freischütz*, and Sister 1 in *Suor Angelica*.\n \nDuring the summer of 2012, Janani performed the role of Musetta in Puccini’s *La Boheme*, at the Teatro Signorelli, in Tuscany, under reknown Maestro Ari Pelto, and in the summer of 2013, Janani gave a stellar performance of Antonia in Les Contes d’Hoffmann with the Martina Arroyo Foundation’s Prelude to Performance. Shortly after, she was also invited to sing the role of Dido in *Dido and Aeneas* with Connecticut Lyric Opera, where she accepted a position in the Young Artist Program for the 2013-12014 season.\n \nJanani is also seasoned in other genres of music. In 2005, she sung the lead role of Anne, in the musical, *Anne of Green Gables*, under the baton of Maestro Steffi Bade. In 2007, she sang \"pop-opera\" in a music video for the Singapore National Day Parade, \"Will You,\" which included seven musicians who were the top in their fields of music. Janani has also performed with jazz greats, Sullivan Fortner, Arnold Lee and De'Sean Jones, at Oberlin College.\n \nWhile pursuing a Master of Music from the Manhattan School of Music, Janani performed in several performances with the Manhattan School of Music Opera Studio. These include Noémie in *Cendrillon*, edited by Tony Amato, Clorinda in *La Cenerentola*, and outreach performances of Valentine’s *Cabaret*, and *The Opera Prince and the Pop Pauper*.\n \nSome of Janani’s other competition credits include first place in the University of  Connecticut Concerto Competition, Amy Jane Cohen Encouragement Award, 3rd place in the National Opera Association Vocal Competition, Young Artist Award in the Harold Haugh Competition, 1st place in the Youth Asian Music Competition, Gold with Distinction in the Youth Asian Music Competition, 1st place in the 58th International Llangollen Musical Eistedfodd, and 1st place in the Young Singer of the Year Awards.\n \nIn 2014 Janani sang in the world premiere of  “this is us”  and *Moments Near New York* by composer Julien Touafek and this year she sang the Soprano solo in the world preimere of *A Child’s Requiem* by Steven Sametz. Some of Janani’s 2014-2015 season operatic roles include: Violetta in *La Traviata*, Pamina in *Die Zauberflöte*, La Bergère, La Chatte and La Chouette in *L'enfant et les Sortilèges*, Mrs. Sem in *Noye’s Fludd*, and Adina in *L’Elisir d’Amore*. Janani is an alumna of the Oberlin Conservatory and the Manhattan School of Music, and is currently pursuing a doctorate at Stony Brook University.",

His work has earned him both Dora (Chan Ka Nin's _Iron Road_) and Gemini awards ([_Bathroom Divas: So You Want To Be an Opera Star?_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNr3dUKocPU) on Bravo!), and he's in huge demand as an operatic acting coach to young professional singers. I first met Tom on the summer program circuit close to ten years ago, and every time I get to work with him, I get inspired and learn something (I'm sure many readers have their own great Tom-Diamond-memories). His extensive resume includes productions with the Canadian Opera Company, [Tapestry New Opera Works](https://tapestryopera.com/tom-diamond), Pacific Opera Victoria, Opera Lyra, and he coaches young singers in the [COC Ensemble Studio](http://www.coc.ca/AboutTheCOC/CompanyMembers/EnsembleStudio.aspx), and [L'opéra de Montréal's Atelier lyrique](http://www.operademontreal.com/en/emerging-artists/atelier-lyrique). Over at the [Ernest Balmer Studio](https://tapestryopera.com/rent), Tom was willing to let me pick his brain this week, so I could share it with my readers. He spoke about the \"Age of the Director\", about his mentorship with the late Richard Bradshaw, and about what he learns from great operatic composers. Enjoy.",

Someone asks for some of the Halloween candy in the big bag that Mike (our Stage Manager) keeps for emergencies. Someone asks for hand sanitizer. A few people Google the address of the school we’re going to, and muse on the pros and cons of various routes.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428879923042/IMG_1421_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Aviva Fortunata (the Cat) sometimes makes muffins for the van. (See above.)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n##9:00am\n\nArrival at the school. A representative from the tour van jumps out to greet the school’s office staff, and to find the easiest path for lugging our equipment to the gymnasium. On good days, we’re greeted by a group of lovely students willing to help with the lugging. We begin an assembly line.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428880040095/IMG_1404_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Andrew Haji (the Rooster) finishing a show set-up.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n##10:00am\n\nTime for show #1\\. The gymnasium is now filled with anywhere from 60 to 300 students, from kindergartners to sixth graders. A teacher quiets the crowd, either with a raise of an arm, a counting system, or some mini game of clapping call-and-answer. The kids hear a quick preamble about what opera is, what show we’re performing for them, and that the aisles must stay clear for the performers. This causes some stirring amongst the crowd. I get a nod from Mike, who is backstage and ready to start.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428880078945/IMG_1588_Fotor.jpg)\n</figure>\n\n##10:12am\n\nMike, Gordon and Andrew are backstage, prepared to flex their puppetry skills with the entrance of the mice. Without fail, the children go absolutely, positively crazy for those mice.\n\n##10:30am\n\nThe entrance of the Robber. Gordon opens his bag of stolen money and pours them joyfully over his head. Coins scatter on the floor in the vicinity, and the front row of children lurch forward to snag themselves a fake gold piece.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428880131457/IMG_1414_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Gordon Bintner (the Miller, the Poet, the Witch, and the Robber)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n##10:42am\n\nThe show has just finished, and we spend a few minutes taking questions from the audience. Plenty of inquiry about the origins of the costumes and sets, and several kids want to know how long the cast has been working as opera singers. Some infrequent concern about the health of my fingers, and the odd philosophical question: “Why did the robber steal?”\n\n##10:55am\n\nThe singers scatter to dressing rooms to get out of costume and remove make-up, while Mike and I begin to tear down the set. It’s week 2, and our tour group makes an art out of delegation, packing up and loading the van in under 20 minutes.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428880230734/IMG_1401_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>The Rooster's make-up kit.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n##11:15am\n\nWe all pile back into the van. Someone asks for a piece of Halloween candy. Someone asks for hand sanitizer. We Google the address of the next school, and someone proactively searches for potential lunch spots nearby. We debrief about particularly funny kids in the audience, the state of the Donkey’s ears, or memorable onstage snafus.\n\n##11:45am\n\nLunch decisions have been made. We notice that there have been a lot of ribs happening at school tour meals. No one is concerned. We marvel at Iain’s grand lunches and bother Mike for details about the afternoon’s school.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428880268378/IMG_1637_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Iain MacNeil (the Donkey) enjoys the first snow, in Manitoulin Island.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n##1:00pm\n\nWe’re fed and caffeinated, and we arrive at the second school of the day. We battle a maze of hallways and unexpected staircases as we haul our beloved set through a brand new school. Several children stop us along the way to ask us who we are and what we’re doing here. We tell them about the opera, and they seem unsatisfied.\n\n##1:15pm\n\nOur second set-up is always fastest. The cast’s dressing rooms are actually gym equipment rooms, filled with childhood treasures like hula hoops, jump ropes, scooters, and tricycles. We all act like children for approximately 15 minutes.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428880320252/IMG_20141107_092207_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>Charlotte Burrage (the Dog), testing out the set.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n##1:55pm\n\nChildren file in, expressing their surprise at our set taking up space in their gym. A few kids stop by the piano to tell me about their respective piano lessons. They ask if I’m an actual piano player. I assure them I’m the real deal.\n\n##2:12pm\n\nThe children go absolutely, positively crazy for the mice.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428880360828/IMG_1378_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>The mice.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n##2:55pm\n\nThe show and Q&A session are over, and children lunge forward to “help” me clean up the dropped coins, still on the floor from the Robber’s scene. They inform me that the coins are fake, and therefore valueless. I learn about the unique relationship between one little girl’s dog and cat.\n\n<figure data-type=\"image\">\n![](/webhook-uploads/1428880425348/IMG_1602_Fotor.jpg)\n<figcaption>The mice.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n##3:15pm\n\nWe finish our patented van-pack, and help Mike dodge children and school buses on the way out of the parking lot. Someone asks for a piece of Halloween candy. Someone asks for hand sanitizer. Someone asks what time we’re meeting tomorrow morning, and others groan at the response.\n\n##4:00pm\n\nWe narrowly escape Toronto-area rush-hour and arrive back at the COC. Representatives get out of the van to help Mike maneuver into a parking spot. We mention that scene in Austin Powers when Mike Myers has to do a 20-point turn in a narrow alley. We confirm the call time for tomorrow morning, cheerily wave goodbye, and remind everyone that the price of being late is a big box of Timbits for the van (we’re not kidding).",

The group included Iain MacNeil (the Donkey), Charlotte Burrage (the Dog), Aviva Fortunata (the Cat), Andrew Haji (the Rooster), Gordon Bintner (the Miller, the Wolf, the Poet, the Witch, and the Robber), Mike Barrs (Stage Manager) and myself (Music Director). While we were way up north, I had the cast sit down for an interview. They even let me put my camera backstage during a show.

Stephen Fry did a special with the Royal Opera House, called _The Science of Opera_, where he went to see _Simon Boccanegra_ with British comedian [Alan Davies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Davies). A team of scientists were on hand to measure their emotional experience throughout the opera. They measured their heart rates and how much they sweat; they even asked Stephen and Alan to press buttons when they were feeling an emotionally climactic moment in the opera. Stephen is a seasoned opera lover, but Alan was a first-timer; it's really fascinating to see what's in common between their experiences of the same thing. There are even appearances by Antonio Pappano and the fab Joyce DiDonato. Great watching for a Sunday afternoon. Enjoy!",

Anyway, in one of her[ series of awesome and smart videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6jidviYzIjuBRq_5mzIgzQ), entitled Tammy Talks, soprano [Tamara Wilson](http://www.tamarawilsonsoprano.com/) sits down with mezzo [Jamie Barton](http://www.jamiebartonmezzo.com/) to talk about body image in the opera industry. I had the brief chance to work with Tammy when she was in Toronto singing Rosalinde in the Canadian Opera Company's production of _Die Fledermaus_, and she proved hilarious, smart, and a seriously solid singer. \n\nI like Tammy and Jamie's take on this issue of operatic fat-shaming. It's more than the issue of a stage-appropriate physique; it really comes down to shaking off critics and finding out how to be happy. Imagine that! Anyway, have a watch of the video below (this is the first of two parts, and you can watch the [second one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHrgVLCJA1U), and have fun perusing the rest of Tammy Talks at her YouTube channel, [EXIT STAGE LEFT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6jidviYzIjuBRq_5mzIgzQ).\n",

Case in point: _The Ophelia Project_. With director Christopher Mirto, she has created _[The Ophelia Project](http://entertainmentdrivethru.com/cree-carrico/)_, a one-woman opera/theatre hybrid exploring the fractured psyche of Shakespeare's Ophelia. The piece stars Cree Carrico and pianist Kyung-Eun Na, and it's an exciting way to develop the \"traditional\" recital format. Cree's own history as a performer includes operatic roles like Vitellia (_La clemenza di Tito_) and Marie Antoinette (_Ghosts of Versailles_), and plenty of theatre experience to boot, like _Carousel_ with the New York Philharmonic (and Nathan Gunn!) and _Flora the Red Menace _ with Oberlin College Theatre.\n\nI had the chance to work with Cree at Oberlin College Conservatory a few years back. She's insatiably creative, and she's fascinated with intertwining music and text. She created a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1780837189/the-ophelia-project) campaign for _The Ophelia Project;_ I asked her all about how the project formed, and why Cree and Ophelia get along so well.\n\nTo donate to _The Ophelia Project_, [click here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1780837189/the-ophelia-project).

Go and see it. For ticket information, click [here](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/Hercules.aspx).\n\nThis past weekend, the incomparable [Peter Sellars](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/with-hercules-peter-sellars-rethinks-the-art-of-war-on-the-stage-of-the-coc/article17717793/) gave a talk to a group of young opera fans as part of the [Canadian Opera Company's Youth Opera Lab](http://www.coc.ca/ExploreAndLearn/YoungAdults/YouthOperaLab.aspx). He walked into the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre, and established _no rules_ by avoiding his neatly placed chair and parking himself amongst his captive audience. (I had a pretty sweet shot lined up, I promise you all.)\nYou could hear a pin drop as Sellars spoke about his [production of _Hercules_](http://www.coc.ca/PerformancesAndTickets/1314Season/Hercules.aspx), his understanding of Handel's life, and about why the relevance of opera is so staggeringly obvious. _Hercules_ is a story about a soldier who returns home after war, and Handel knew that story included the soldier's family. Peter Sellars is truly a master of answering the crucial question: why do we have art? Why do we need it?\n\nIn what had to be the most difficult editing job yet, here are a few moments of clarity from Peter.\n",

We had the chance to chat last year, and he spoke about working with young singers, conducting opera, and about the power of live theatre.

But this time, I struck gold. \n\n*Don Giovanni Unmasked* is a film version of Mozart's masterpiece, produced by the CBC and directed Barbara Willis Sweete, of [The Metropolitan Opera's Live in HD Broadcasts](http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2012/11/03/torontos-barbara-willis-sweete-the-master-of-1100-camera-angles-for-metropolitan-opera-otello-in-hd/).\n\nThere are so many amazing things about this. \n\n1. First of all, Dmitri Hvorostovsky stars as the Don...*and* Leporello. Love it. But wait, it gets better!\n\n2. The music was conducted by Richard Bradshaw, leading the COC Orchestra.\n\n3. The cast is full of Canadians: Alain Coulombe (Masetto), Krisztina Szabó (Zerlina),  Michael Colvin (Ottavio), Dominique Labelle (Donna Anna), Barbara Dunn-Prosser (Donna Elvira), and Gary Relyea (the Commendatore).\n\n*Don Giovanni Unmasked* left me pretty confused on a lot of fronts, but it's oddly riveting. The concept is bizarre, with Leporello as the emcee of a film screening; in said film (black & white, of course) is where we see Don Giovanni, dressed in a way that makes me think of Zorro. So, that means that sometimes Dmitri Hvorostovsky is talking to himself through a movie screen. Plus, there's a pretty crazy plot twist at the end.\n\nEnjoy!\n",

The concept is bizarre, with Leporello as the emcee of a film screening; in said film (black & white, of course) is where we see Don Giovanni, dressed in a way that makes me think of Zorro. So, that means that sometimes Dmitri Hvorostovsky is talking to himself through a movie screen. Plus, there's a pretty crazy plot twist at the end.",
